# Openness in Goods and Financial Markets
>[!warning] Exports Can Exceed GDP
>GDP is value added domestically, not gross output. Exports and imports may include exports and imports of intermediate goods which are not included in GDP calculation

## Exchange Rate
- Real exchange rate $=\epsilon$
	- The price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods
	- determine how people choose between domestic vs, foreign goods
- Nominal exchange rate $=E$
	- conversion ratio between two currencies
	- 1-unit home currency = $E$ unit foreign currency
	- e.g., 1 USD = 7.8 HKD

$$\epsilon=\frac{EP}{P^{*}}=E \frac{P}{P*}$$

where $P$ is the home price level and $P^*$ is the foreign price level.

>nominal and real exchange rates can move in opposite directions

## Balance of Payments (BOP)
- **Current Account (CA)**
    
    - Records trade in goods & services (exports − imports).
        
    - Trade surplus → CA > 0.
        
    - Trade deficit → CA < 0.
        
- **Financial/Capital Account (FA)**
    
    - Records cross-border investment in assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, bank deposits).
        
    - Inflows = foreigners buying domestic assets.
        
    - Outflows = residents buying foreign assets.

Foreign currencies are needed both to pay for imports and to buy foreign assets.

- e.g., a country that imports more than it exports (trade deficit) must attract foreign capital (borrow from foreign countries)
	- Current account deficit $=$ Capital account surplus

$$BoP=\text{Current account balance}+\text{Capital account balance}=0$$

> Except for countries with closed or controlled capital accounts

## Uncovered Interest Parity

Foreign and home bonds must offer the **same expected rate of return**

- Otherwise, an arbitrage currency carry trade is possible.

$$(1+i_{t})=\frac{E_{t}(1+i_{t}^{*})}{E_{t+1}^{e}}=(1+i_{t}^{*})\frac{E_{t}}{E_{t+1}^{e}}$$

where $E_{t+1}^{e}$ is the expected future exchange rate.

$$(1+i_{t})=(1+i_{t}^{*})\frac{E_{t}}{E_{t+1}^{e}}=\frac{1+i_{t}^{*}}{1+\frac{E_{t+1}^{e}-E_{t}}{E_{t}}}$$

Use $(1+x)(1+y)\approx 1+x+y$ approximation, we obtain

$$i_{t}\approx i_{t}^{*}-\frac{E_{t+1}^{e}-E_{t}}{E_{t}}$$

$$i_{t}^*>i_{t}\iff E_{t+1}^{e}>E_{t}$$

>[!tip] Implications
>- If the home interest rate is lower, we are still willing to hold domestic bonds only because we **expect** home currency to appreciate relative to that foreign currency.
>- If we want the exchange rate between two currencies to stay stable, domestic and foreign interest rates must move very closely together.
