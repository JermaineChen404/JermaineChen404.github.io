# The Goods Market in an Open Economy
Demand for domestic goods becomes:

$$Z\equiv C+I+G-\frac{IM}{\epsilon}+X$$

since imports are measured by the foreign currency, we need to adjust it by the real exchange rate.

## Imports
$$IM=IM(\underset{(+,+)}{Y,\epsilon})$$

- increase in domestic income $Y$ $\to$ IM increase
- increase in $\epsilon\to$ IM increase
	- The price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods rises, so foreign goods become cheaper.

## Exports
$$X=X(\underset{(+,-)}{Y^{*},\epsilon})$$

- increase in foreign income $Y^{*}$ $\to$ X increase
- increase in $\epsilon\to$ X decrease
	- The price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods rises, so foreign goods become cheaper.

## Graph

- $DD=C+I+G$
	- domestic demand for all goods
- $AA=C+I+G-\frac{IM}{\epsilon}$
	- domestic demand for domestic goods
		- flatter than DD
			- As the total demand rises with income, some of the increase **"leaks"** abroad
- $ZZ=C+I+G-\frac{IM}{\epsilon}+X$
	- all demand for domestic goods

## Equilibrium in the Goods Market
All-in-one, demand for domestic goods is given by

$$Z\equiv C(Y-T)+I(Y,i)+G-\frac{IM(Y,\epsilon)}{\epsilon}+X(Y^{*},\epsilon)$$

The equilibrium of the goods market becomes

$$Y=C(Y-T)+I(Y,i)+G-\frac{IM(Y,\epsilon)}{\epsilon}+X(Y^{*},\epsilon)$$

$$NX=ZZ-DD$$

At equilibrium, trade balance (NX) could be in deficit or surplus. It depends on the relationship between domestic demand, IM and X.

### Increase in Domestic Demand

- $NX$ curve is independent of fiscal policy
- Change in equilibrium will impact the trade balance
	- Import depends on $Y$, but export does not
- The effect of fiscal policy on $Y$ is smaller in an open economy.
	- smaller multiplier

### Increase in Foreign Demand
![[Pasted image 20251210011328.png]]

- $ZZ$ shifts up, but no change in $DD$
- $NX=ZZ-DD$ shifts up
- Increased $Y$ leads to trade surplus

|Scenario|Effect on YY|Effect on Trade Balance (NX)|NX Curve Response|
|---|---|---|---|
|**↑ Domestic demand** (e.g. ↑C, ↑I, ↑G)|Y↑|NX deteriorates (imports ↑, exports fixed)|**Move along** NX curve (downward along the curve)|
|**↑ Foreign demand** (↑X)|Y↑|NX improves (exports ↑, imports unchanged initially)|**NX curve shifts up** (parallel upward shift)|

### The Marshall-Lerner Condition
$$NX=X(Y^{*},\epsilon)-\frac{IM(Y,\epsilon)}{\epsilon}$$

Under ML Condition, a real depreciation ($\downarrow \epsilon$) leads to an increase in $NX$

- Overall $Z Z$ moves up, and $NX$ shifts up
- Same effects as an increase in foreign demand 

Policy mix: Depreciation and fiscal policy together

![[Pasted image 20251210020608.png]]

- Under the ML Condition, depreciation increases $Y$ and shifts up $NX$ to $NX’$.
	- eliminate trade deficit at the initial $Y$, but the new $Y'$ creates new deficit
- Fiscal contraction reduces $Y$ back.
	- push back $Y$ and thus improve $NX$ (move along the new $NX'$)

## Saving, Investment, and Trade Balance
$$Y= C+I+G-\frac{IM}{\epsilon}+X$$

$$CA+I=S+(T-G)$$

where $CA=X-\frac{IM}{\epsilon}$ is the Current Account.

- high saving must come with higher investment and/or large trade surplus
