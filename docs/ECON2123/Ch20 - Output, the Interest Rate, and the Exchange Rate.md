# Output, the Interest Rate, and the Exchange Rate
## The IS Relation in Open Economy
$$Y=C(Y-T)+I(Y,r)+G-\frac{IM(Y,\epsilon)}{\epsilon}+X(Y^{*},\epsilon)$$

$$NX\equiv X(Y^{*},\epsilon)-\frac{IM(Y,\epsilon)}{\epsilon}$$

Thus,

$$Y\underset{(+)}{(Y-T)}+I\underset{(+,-)}{(Y,r)}+G+NX\underset{(-,+,-)}{(Y,Y^{*},\epsilon)}$$

Both the Real Interest Rate (r) and Real Exchange Rate (𝜖) affect the demand for domestic goods.

In short run, we assume fixed price levels. Thus, Real and nominal exchange rates and interest rates move one-for-one.

Therefore, Y is determined by nominal i and E:

$$Y\underset{(+)}{(Y-T)}+I\underset{(+,-)}{(Y,i)}+G+NX\underset{(-,+,-)}{(Y,Y^{*},E)}$$

## The LM Relation in Open Economy
$$\frac{M}{P}=YL(i)$$

At the equilibrium, UIP holds. Assume exogenous (given) expected exchange rate

$$E=\frac{1+i}{1+i^{*}}\bar{E}^{e}$$

Given $i^{*}$ and $\bar{E}^{e}$, $i$ is linear to $E$.

- $\uparrow i\to$ higher return on US bonds $\to$ investors switch to USD $\to$ USD appreciate ($\uparrow E$)
- changes in $i$ lead to immediate changes in $E$
- when $E=\bar{E}^{e}$, $i=i^{*}$

Given $i^{*}$ and $i$,

- If expected exchange rate increases (so domestic currency will be more expensive), more domestic currency is wanted as a result. E must increase immediately
- To maintain the same interest rates, current E must reflect future expectations on E.

## The IS-LM in Open Economy
$$Y\underset{(+)}{(Y-T)}+I\underset{(+,-)}{(Y,i)}+G+NX\underset{(-,+,-)}{(Y,Y^{*},\frac{1+i}{1+i^{*}}\bar{E}^{e})}$$

When i increases

- Direct effect: Increase in $i$ lowers investment $\to$ lower demand
- Indirect effect: Increase in $i\to$ appreciation in $E\to$ decrease in $NX$

### Flexible Exchange Rate

Fiscal or monetary policy no only changes Y and i, but also allows E to freely adjust.

### Fixed Exchange Rate

![[Pasted image 20251210025216.png]]

Under fixed exchange rate system, the government (and its central bank) gives up its monetary policy ($i=i^{*}$)

- fiscal policy becoming more powerful

Monetary accommodation would amplify the effect of fiscal policy

- Y could have stayed the same with the correct monetary policy mix. But instead, things are made worse to maintain fixed exchange rate
