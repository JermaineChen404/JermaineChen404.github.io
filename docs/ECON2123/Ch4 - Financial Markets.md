# Financial Markets
Money $=$ Cash (currency) $+$ Checkable deposits

- medium of exchange (the most liquid)
- zero return

The demand for money is determined by the tradeoff between return and liquidity.
## The Demand for Money
$$M^d=\$Y\underset{(-)}{L(i)}$$

- increases proportionally with **nominal income** $\$Y$
	- captures liquidity need for money
- decreases with the interest rate, described by $L(i)$
	- captures opportunity cost of money

## Money Market Equilibrium
$$M^{d}=M^{s}$$

Suppose the central bank decides to supply an amount of money equal to $M$, i.e.,

$$M^s=M$$

The equilibrium condition becomes

$$M=\$YL(i)$$

which is called **LM relation**

- L $\rightarrow$ liquidity: how easily an asset can be exchanged for money
- M $\rightarrow$ money: the most liquid of all assets
- LM relation $\rightarrow$ demand for liquidity = supply of money

Interest rate $i$ must be such that people are willing to hold an amount of money equal to the existing money supply $M$ given their income $\$Y$

- Money supply is independent of the interest rate
- Money demand depends on the interest rate

>Increased nominal income increase the demand for money. Since $M^d>M^S$, people are more willing to hold money instead of bond. As a result, bond price decreases, and thus interest rate increases until $M^{d}=M^{S}$ again.

>$$i=\frac{100-P_{B}}{P_{B}}\quad\Rightarrow\quad P_{B}=\frac{100}{1+i}$$

>Higher bond price lowers the return $i$, and vice versa.

### Monetary Policy
$M^{S}$ is exogenous.

- Central bank chooses $M^S$ as a policy tool to **achieve a target interest rate** $i$

>[!note] Open Market Operations
>Buying or selling bonds by the central bank to change $M^S$
>
>- Expansionary policy
>	- Buying bonds to increase $M^S$
>	- $i \downarrow$
>- Contractionary policy
>	- Selling bonds to decrease $M^S$
>	- $i \uparrow$

## Introducing Private Banks
Introduce checkable deposits issued by private banks.

$$\text{Reserve Ratio}=\frac{\text{Reserve}}{\text{Checkable deposits}}$$


### Demand for Money
- $c$ : fixed proportion of people's money in currency
- $CU^d$ : demand for currency
- $D^d$ : demand for checkable deposits

$$CU^d=cM^d$$

$$D^d=(1-c)M^d$$

### Demand for Reserves
$\theta$ : Reserve Ratio

$$R=\theta D$$

Demand for reserves is given by

$$R^d=\theta(1-c)M^d$$

### Demand for Central Bank Money
$H^d$ : demand for central bank money

$$
\begin{align}
H^d&=CU^d+R^d \\
&=cM^d+\theta(1-c)M^d \\
&=[c+\theta(1-c)]M^d
\end{align}
$$

Given that $M^{d=}\$YL(i)$

$$H^d=[c+\theta(1-c)]\,\$YL(i)$$

### Determination of the Interest Rate
$H$ as the supply of central bank money is directly controlled by central bank

$$H=H^d=[c+\theta(1-c)]\,\$YL(i)$$

Given that $0<c<1$

$$H^d<M^d$$

i.e., the demand for central bank money is less than the demand for overall money
