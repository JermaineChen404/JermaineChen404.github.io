# The Labor Market
## Wage Determination
>[!note] Bargaining theory
>a worker’s bargaining power depends on the nature of the job and the labor market condition.

>[!note] Efficient wage theory
> link labor productivity with the wage they get, i.e., about incentives to motivate workers.

$$W=P^{e}F\underset{(-,+)}{(u,z)}$$

- $W=$ Aggregate **nominal** wage
- $P^e=$ **Expected** price level
- $u=$ unemployment rate
- $z=$ all other variables that may affect the outcome of wage setting
	- unemployment benefit
	- labor protection
	- minimum wage law

If changes in the price level are expected, nominal wage must be adjusted proportionally to keep real wage intact.

## Price Determination
Assume production uses only labor

$$Y=AN$$

- $Y=$ output
- $N=$ employment
- $A=$ marginal product of labor (MPL)
- Marginal cost of production $=W$ (wage)

We further assume $A=1$ for simplicity,

$$Y=N$$

Firms set the price per unit of output according to

$$P=(1+m)W$$

- Proportional to marginal cost of production, $W$
- $m$ is the markup of the price over the marginal cost

Rewrite in terms of **real** wage:

$$\frac{W}{P}=\frac{1}{1+m}$$

## Medium-Run Equilibrium
In the medium run equilibrium, we forecast perfectly what price changes will take place.

i.e., we assume $P^{e}=P$

- Wage-setting: $\frac{W}{P}=F(u,z)$
- Price-setting: $\frac{W}{P}=\frac{1}{1+m}$

$$\text{real wage chosen in wage setting}=\text{real wage implied by price setting}$$

**The natural rate of unemployment** is the unemployment rate such that the real wage chosen in wage setting is equal to the real wage implied by price setting.

## Unemployment to Employment to Output
$$u=\frac{U}{L}=\frac{L-N}{L}$$

The natural level of employment is given by

$$N_{n}=L(1-u_{n})$$

The natural level of output is given by

$$Y_{n}=N_{n}=L(1-u_{n})$$

Thus, 

$$F\left( 1-\frac{Y_{n}}{L},z \right)=\frac{1}{1+m}$$

WS and PS relations determine the natural rate of unemployment, natural level of employment, and the natural level of output (the max production capacity)
