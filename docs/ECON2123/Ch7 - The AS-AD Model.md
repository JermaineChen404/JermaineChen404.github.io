# The AS-AD Model
## Aggregate Supply
Given

$$F\left( 1-\frac{Y_{n}}{L},z \right)=\frac{1}{1+m}$$

We obtain the AS relation

$$P=P^{e}(1+m)\,F\left( 1-\frac{Y_{n}}{L},z \right)$$

- Exogenous: $m$, $z$, $L$
- Endogenous: $P$ depends on $Y$ and $P^e$
	- For a given $P^e$ , higher $Y$ leads to higher $P$
	- For a given $Y$, higher $P^e$ leads to higher $P$

Given the expected price level,

- an increase in output leads to an increase in the price level.
- If output is equal to the natural level of output, the price level is equal to the expected price level.

An increase in the expected price level shifts the aggregate supply curve up.

## Aggregate Demand
The IS-LM equilibrium can be characterized as

$$Y=Y\underset{(+,+,-)}{\left( \frac{M}{P},G,T \right)}$$

- Exogenous: $M$, $G$, $T$ given by policy
- Endogenous: $Y$ depends on $P$
	- For a given $P^e$ , higher $Y$ leads to higher $P$
	- For a given $Y$, higher $P^e$ leads to higher $P$

An increase in the price level leads to a decrease in output.

Changes in monetary or fiscal policy – or more generally in any variable, other than the price level, that shifts the IS or the LM curves – shift the aggregate demand curve.

- Equilibrium output increases with
	- Nominal money supply (through a downward shift of LM)
	- Government spending (through a rightward shift of IS)
- Equilibrium output decreases with
	- Taxes (through a left-ward shift of IS)
