# Binomial Tree Models

## Pricing Principles

### Asset Pricing

The price of any asset is the present value of its expected future value (or cash flows) using a risk-adjusted discount rate:

$$S_{0}=e^{-\mu T}\mathbb{E}_{0}[S_{T}]$$

Since the asset itself carries risk that cannot be perfectly hedged, investors demand compensation for bearing the risk. The discount rate reflects both the time value of money and the risk premium.

### Derivative Pricing

The price of a derivative is determined by the cost of replicating or hedging its payoff.

Traders sell and hedge derivatives immediately since they do not want to bear the fundamental risks that are on the other side of their clients. Instead, they only charge a mark-up for providing liquidity.

## One Step Binomial Tree

Consider a call option with payoff as shown above. Since there are only two possible outcomes, we can always construct a portfolio of two securities **(long $\Delta$ of shares and short the option)** with **no uncertainty about the final value (riskless)**. The portfolio is riskless if the final value of the portfolio is the same for both alternatives.

### Cost of Hedging Pricing

The riskless portfolio is:

$$S_{0}u\Delta-f_{u}=S_{0}d\Delta-f_{d}$$

Solving for $\Delta$:

$$\Delta=\frac{f_{u}-f_{d}}{S_{0}u-S_{0}d}$$

In this case, the portfolio is riskless and, for there to be no arbitrage opportunities, it must earn the risk-free interest rate.

If we denote the risk-free interest rate by $r$, the present value of the portfolio is:

$$(S_{0}u\Delta-f_{u})e^{-rT}$$

The cost of setting up the portfolio is:

$$S_{0}\Delta-f$$

From the no-arbitrage principle:

$$(S_{0}u\Delta-f_{u})e^{-rT}=S_{0}\Delta-f$$

Substituting $\Delta$, we obtain the current price of the option:

$$f=\frac{f_{u}(1-de^{-rT})+f_{d}(ue^{-rT}-1)}{u-d}$$

Or equivalently:

$$f=e^{-rT}[pf_{u}+(1-p)f_{d}]$$

where:

$$p=\frac{e^{rT}-d}{u-d}$$

> The option pricing formula obtained does not involve the probabilities of the stock price moving up or down. Why?
>
> - Knowing $S_{0}u$ and $S_{0}d$ is enough for perfectly hedging (replicating) the option
> - We are calculating its value in terms of the price of the underlying stock. The probabilities of future up or down movements are already incorporated into the stock price; we do not need to account for them again when valuing the option in terms of the stock price.

## Risk-Neutral Pricing

We introduce a **risk-neutral world** where investors are risk-neutral as opposed to risk-averse.

> In reality, people are **risk-averse**: they dislike risk and thus require a higher expected return as compensation for increased risks.

### Risk-Neutral World Assumptions

In the risk-neutral world:

- The expected return on any asset is the risk-free rate
- The discount rate used for the expected payoff on any derivative is the risk-free rate

The option pricing formula becomes:

$$f=e^{-rT}[pf_{u}+(1-p)f_{d}]$$

where $p$ is the probability of an up movement **in a risk-neutral world**, and:

$$pf_{u}+(1-p)f_{d}=\mathbb{E}_{0}^{*}[f_{T}]$$

is the expected future payoff from the option in a risk-neutral world.

Thus:

$$f=e^{-rT}\mathbb{E}_{0}^{*}[f_{T}]$$

This states that the value of the option today is its expected future payoff in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate.

### Risk-Neutral Stock Price Growth

Since $p$ is the probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral world, the expected stock price is:

$$\mathbb{E}[S_{T}]=pS_{0}u+(1-p)S_{0}d$$

Substituting for $p$ gives:

$$\mathbb{E}[S_{T}]=S_{0}e^{rT}$$

This means the stock price grows, on average, **at the risk-free rate** as well in the risk-neutral world.

> **Key Insight:** The price we obtain in the risk-neutral world is the right price in all worlds (in the real world as well).

## Applications

### Forward Contracts Revisited

The payoff at $T$ from a forward contract is:

$$G(S_{T})\equiv S_{T}-F_{0,T}$$

The value of a forward today is zero, and according to the conclusion above:

$$e^{-rT}\times \mathbb{E}_{0}^{*}[S_{T}-F_{0,T}]=0$$

Thus:

$$F_{0,T}=\mathbb{E}_{0}^{*}[S_{T}]=S_{0}\times e^{rT}$$

i.e., **The forward price is the risk-neutral expectation of the underlying price at $T$**

$$F_{0,T}=\mathbb{E}_{0}^{*}[S_{T}]\neq \mathbb{E}_{0}[S_{T}]$$

However, with the real expectation $E[S_{T}]=S_{0}\times e^{\mu T}$:

$$F_{0,T}=e^{-(\mu-r)T}E[S_{T}]$$

The forward price is the expected future stock price, discounted at the excess rate of return $(\mu-r)$.

### Swaps Revisited

In a swap, two counterparties agree to exchange cashflows at $T_{1},T_{2},\dots,T_{n}$:

$$\text{Cash Flow at }T_{i}\equiv G(S_{T_{i}})=S_{T_{i}}-x$$

The value of the swap at time $0$ is:

$$V_{0}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-rT_{i}} E_{0}^{*}[S_{T_{i}}-x]$$

Since $F_{0,T}=E_{0}^{*}[S_{T}]$:

$$V_{0}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-rT_{i}} (F_{0,T_{i}}-x)$$

To solve for $x$, we set $V_{0}=0$ and obtain:

$$x=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}F_{0,T_{i}} \quad \text{where} \quad w_{i}=\frac{e^{-rT_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-rT_{i}}}$$
