# The Black-Scholes-Merton Model

## Assumptions

The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is built on the following assumptions:

- Financial markets have no frictions
  - No taxes and transaction costs
  - Assets are perfectly divisible
  - No restrictions on short sales
- Same and constant interest rate for borrowing and lending
- The stock price has a continuous path (no jumps)
- The mean and variance of the log returns are constant
- Independent log returns over any period
- Normally distributed log returns

## Input Parameters

- $S_{t}$ = stock price at time $t$
- $K$ = strike price
- $T$ = maturity time
- $t$ = current time
- $r$ = annualized continuously compounded risk-free interest rate
- $\sigma$ = annualized standard deviation of log returns
- $q$ = continuously compounded dividend yield

## BSM Formulas

### European Call Option

The value of a European call option at time $t$ is:

$$C(S_{t},\sigma,r,K,T-t)=S_{t}e^{-q(T-t)}N(d_{1})-Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})$$

where:

$$d_{1}=\frac{\ln\left(\frac{S_{t}}{K}\right)+\left(r+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}$$

$$d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma \sqrt{T-t}=\frac{\ln\left(\frac{S_{t}}{K}\right)+\left(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}$$

Here, $N(X)$ is the cumulative density function of a standard normal random variable.

### European Put Option

The value of a European put option on the same stock with the same strike price is:

$$P(S_{t},\sigma,r,K,T-t)=Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_{2})-S_{t}e^{-q(T-t)}N(-d_{1})$$

### Put-Call Parity

Since $N(X)=1-N(-X)$:

$$\text{Call}-\text{Put}=S_{t}e^{-q(T-t)}-Ke^{-r(T-t)}$$

which is consistent with the Put-Call Parity relationship.

## Interpretation

### From Replicating Portfolio to BSM

The BSM formula expresses an option as a self-financing portfolio of stock and bond that changes over time.

#### For Call Options

- $N(d_{1})$ is the **number of shares** in the replicating portfolio at time $t$
  - Equivalent to $\Delta$ in the binomial model
  - Also the sensitivity of the call's price to the stock price:

$$\Delta_{call}=\frac{\partial C}{\partial S_{t}}=N(d_{1})\in(0,1)$$

- $Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})$ is the value of bonds we short in the replicating portfolio

Thus, the BSM formula states:

$$C(S_{t},\sigma,r,K,T-t)=\Delta_{call}S_{t}-B_{call}=S_{t}N(d_{1})-Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})$$

#### For Put Options

- $\Delta_{put}=\frac{\partial P}{\partial S_{t}}=-N(-d_{1})=-(1-N(d_{1}))<0$ is the number of shares we short
- $Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_{2})$ is the value of bonds we long in the replicating portfolio

$$P(S_{t},\sigma,r,K,T-t)=B_{put}-\Delta_{put}S_{t}=Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_{2})-S_{t}N(-d_{1})$$

### From Binomial Tree to BSM

Different approaches lead to the BSM formula:

- **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein:** Use a binomial tree and make the step size very small and the number of steps very large
- **Merton:** The option price is based on the risk-neutral expectation of the option payoffs, i.e., solve $E^{*}[\max(S_{T}-K,0)]$
- **Black-Scholes:** Derive a partial differential equation for the option price based on dynamic hedging portfolios

#### One-Step Binomial Connection

For a one-step binomial tree:

$$\begin{align}
C_{0}&=e^{-rT}E^{*}[\max(S_{1}-K,0)]=e^{-rT}p(S_{1,u}-K) \\
&=S_{0}\times(e^{-rT}pu)-Ke^{-rT}\times p \\
&=S_{0}\times N_{1}-Ke^{-rT}\times N_{2}
\end{align}$$

which resembles the BSM formula:

$$C_{0}=S_{0}\times N(d_{1})-Ke^{-rT}\times N(d_{2})$$

This analogy gives another interpretation angle:

- $N(d_{2})$ is the risk-neutral probability of exercising the option at $T$
- $S_{0}\times N(d_{1})$ is the discounted expected value of the stock received from the call
- $Ke^{-rT}\times N(d_{2})$ is the discounted expected value of the strike paid on the call

#### Limit of Binomial Model

For an $n$-step binomial tree:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} N_{1}=N(d_{1}) \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} N_{2}=N(d_{2})$$

Thus, **the BSM model is the limit of the binomial tree when the number of steps $n$ goes to infinity**.

## The Option Greeks

The Greeks measure the sensitivity of the option price with respect to one parameter in the BSM formula, while holding all other parameters fixed.

### Delta ($\Delta$)

Sensitivity of the option price to a small increase in the price of the underlying:

$$\Delta = \frac{\partial \text{Option Price}}{\partial S} = 
\begin{cases} 
\mathcal{N}(d_1) & \text{for Calls} \\
-\mathcal{N}(-d_1) & \text{for Puts}
\end{cases}$$

#### Interpretation

For call delta:

- As $S\gg K$ (deep in-the-money)
  - $d_1 \to \infty$, so $\Delta_{call}=\mathcal{N}(d_1) \to 1$
  - Already guaranteed to pay off, moves almost one-for-one with the stock

- As $S \ll K$ (deep out-of-the-money)
  - Delta approaches 0
  - Unlikely to pay off

For puts:

$$\Delta_{put}=-N(-d_{1})=N(d_{1})-1=\Delta_{call}-1$$

### Gamma ($\Gamma$)

Sensitivity of Delta to a small increase in the price of the underlying:

$$\Gamma = \frac{\partial \Delta}{\partial S} = \frac{\mathcal{N}'(d_1)}{S \sigma \sqrt{T}} 
\quad \text{where} \quad 
\mathcal{N}'(x) = \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$$

#### Key Property

$$\Gamma_{call}=\Gamma_{put}$$

**Proof:**

$$C-P=S-Ke^{-r(T-t)}$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial S}(C-P)=\Delta_{call}-\Delta_{put}=1$$

$$\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial S^2}(C-P)=\Gamma_{call}-\Gamma_{put}=0$$

### Theta ($\Theta$)

Sensitivity of the option price to a small **decrease** in the time to maturity $\tau$:

$$\Theta=-\frac{\partial \text{Option Price}}{\partial\,\tau}$$

#### For Call Options

$\Theta<0$ for all call options

- If $S$ is high (in-the-money)
  - The discounted value of the strike call buyers pay is larger as $\tau$ is smaller
  - **Discounting effect:** Pay more as maturity approaches

- If $S$ is low (out-of-the-money)
  - A smaller $\tau$ makes it less likely the call will be exercised
  - **Uncertainty effect**

#### For Put Options

$\Theta<0$ for high $S$ and $\Theta>0$ for low $S$

- If $S$ is high (out-of-the-money)
  - A smaller $\tau$ makes it less likely the put will be exercised
  - **Uncertainty effect**

- If $S$ is low (in-the-money)
  - The discounted value of the strike put buyers receive is larger as $\tau$ is smaller
  - **Discounting effect:** Receive more as maturity approaches

### Vega ($\mathcal{V}$)

Sensitivity of the option price to a small increase in volatility $\sigma$:

$$\mathcal{V} = \frac{\partial \text{Option Price}}{\partial \sigma} = S \sqrt{\tau}\, \mathcal{N}'(d_1) > 0$$

#### Interpretation

When volatility increases, both put and call prices increase since options have a higher chance of being exercised.

**Key Property:** Vega is the same for calls and puts.
