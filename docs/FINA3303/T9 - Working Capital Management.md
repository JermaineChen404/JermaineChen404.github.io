# Working Capital Management
Efficiently managing working capital will maximize firm value.

- Any reduction in working capital requirements generates a positive free cash flow that the firm can distribute immediately to shareholders, and thus increase firm value.
## Net Working Capital (NWC)
$$\text{Net Working Capital}=\text{Current Assets}-\text{Current Liabilities}$$

Net working capital is the capital required in the short term to run the business.

- Cash Management
- Receivables Management
- Inventory Management
- Payables Management

## Cycle
![[Pasted image 20251103014049.png]]

### Operating Cycle
Operating cycle is the average length of time between when a firm originally **purchases its inventory** and when it **receives the cash** back from selling its product

### Cash Cycle
Cash cycle is the length of time between when the firm **pays cash** to purchase its initial inventory and when it **receives cash** from the sale of the output produced from that inventory.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)}&=\text{Account Receivable Days}+\text{Inventory Days}-\text{Accounts Payable Days} \\
&=\text{Operating Cycle}-\text{Accounts Payable Days}
\end{align}
$$

or

$$\text{Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)}+\text{Accounts Payable Days}=\text{Account Receivable Days}+\text{Inventory Days}$$

where

$$\begin{align}
\text{Accounts Receivable Days}&=\frac{\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Average Daily Sales}} \\
\text{Accounts Payable Days}&=\frac{\text{Accounts Payable}}{\text{Average COGS}} \\
\text{Inventory Days}&=\frac{\text{Inventory}}{\text{Average COGS}}
\end{align}$$

Negative CCC implies

- Cash-in before Cash-out
	- use customers' cash to finance the business
	- use suppliers as a source of free credit
- Highly efficient Working Capital Management
	- keep minimal cash to operate
- Require strong **Five Force**

> [!Example] Five Forces

>- Threat of New Entrants

>- Intensity of Rivalry Among Existing Competitors

## Trade Credit
Trade credit is the credit that the suppliers is extending to its customers. Suppliers would prefer to be paid in cash, but it might lose customers.

>[!Term]
>2/10 Net 30
>
>- due in 30 days
>- If pay within 10 days, receive a 2% discount

### Cost of Trade Credit
Consider 2/10 net 30. The customer could have paid full \$100 until day 30, however, they agree to pay 20 days earlier at day 10 in exchange of \$2. It is equivalent to that the customer lend \$98 to the supplier with a interest payment of  \$2 and a maturity of 20 days.

The effective annual cost for this loan is given by

$$EAR=\left( 1+\frac{2}{98} \right)^{365/20}-1$$

Generally, for $x$/$m$ net $n$,

$$EAR=\left( \frac{100}{100-x} \right)^{365/(n-m)}-1$$

This is the effective annual cost to the customer if it choose not to take advantage of the trade discount offered. In other word, as long as the customer can access a loan at a lower interest rate, it would be better off borrowing at the lower rate on day $m$ and use to cash proceeds of the loan to take advantage of the discount offered by the supplier, and repay the loan on day $n$.

### Benefits for Suppliers
- an implicit way of price discrimination
	- providing financing at below-market rates indirectly lowers prices for only certain customers
- better info about the credit quality of the customers than a bank
	- have an ongoing business relationship
- better capability to handle default risks
	- suppliers can better handle the inventory as collateral (at a lower cost) than a bank
