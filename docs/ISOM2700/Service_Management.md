# Service Management
Given random variable $L_{n}$ in queue, $A_{n}$ of arrivals, and $C_{n}$ of capacity,

$$L_{n}=\max(A_{n}+L_{n-1}-C_{n},0)$$

Queues exist due to
- variability of arrival process
	- random input (arrival)
- variability of service time
	- resources breakdown/maintenance

## Queuing Model
### M/M/s Model
**Kendall's notation**：

Markovian/Markovian/# of servers

Input of the queue
- Exponential inter-arrival time: arrival rate $=\lambda$
	- customer/period
- Exponential service time: service rate *at each server* $=\mu$
	- customer/period
- Number of servers $=s$
- Assumption:
	- one queue
	- First-come-first-serve
	- $\lambda<s\mu$

Output of the queue (System performance measures)
- Average number of customers in the queue $L_{q}$ or in the system $L$
- Average time spent in the queue $W_{q}$ or in the system $W$
- Probability of delay
- Utilization of the server $\rho$

### Service Utilization $\rho$
![[Pasted image 20251020180838.png]]
Given the assumption $\lambda<s\mu$,

$$\rho=\frac{\lambda}{s\mu}<100\%$$

Server utilization is the average fraction of time a server is busy.

### Random Variable

#### Random Number of Arrivals

#### Number vs. Time
A process that has exponentially distributed inter-arrival/service times is, by definition, a **Poisson Process**.

Let the random variable $T$ represent the inter-arrival time, we state that

$$T\sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate. The mean of this distribution is $E[T]=\frac{1}{\lambda}$.

Define a new random variable $N_{t}$ representing the number of arrivals, thus

$$N_{t}\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda t)$$

### Queuing System Cost Tradeoff
- $C_{w}=$ Cost of waiting per customer per hour
- $L_{q}=$ Mean number of waiting customers
- $C_{s}=$ Cost of service per server per hour
- $S=$ Number of servers

$$\text{Total Cost}=C_{s}S+C_{w}L_{q}$$
