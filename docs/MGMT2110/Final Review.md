# Final Review
## Chapter 1: What Is Organizational Behavior (OB)

### 1.1 Core Definitions

- **Organizational Behavior (OB)**: A field of study investigating the impact of _individuals, groups, and structure_ on behavior within organizations, with the goal of improving organizational effectiveness.
    
- **Worker**: An individual who contributes to the accomplishment of organizational goals (includes full-time, part-time, gig, and contract workers).
    
- **Manager**: An individual who achieves goals through other people; responsible for planning, organizing, leading, and controlling.
    
- **Organization**: A consciously coordinated social unit (≥2 people) that functions continuously to achieve common goals (e.g., firms, schools, hospitals).
    

### 1.2 Managerial Roles & Skills

- **Mintzberg’s Managerial Roles** (3 categories):
    
    - **Interpersonal**: Figurehead (ceremonial duties), Leader (motivate/train employees), Liaison (network with external contacts).
        
    - **Informational**: Monitor (collect external/internal info), Disseminator (share info with employees), Spokesperson (represent the organization externally).
        
    - **Decisional**: Entrepreneur (initiate change), Disturbance Handler (resolve crises), Resource Allocator (allocate human/physical/monetary resources), Negotiator (bargain with internal/external parties).
        
- **Managerial Skills**:
    
    - **Technical Skills**: Apply specialized knowledge/expertise (e.g., engineering, accounting).
        
    - **People Skills**: Understand, communicate with, and motivate others (critical for leading teams).
        
    - **Conceptual Skills**: Analyze complex situations and make strategic decisions (e.g., problem-solving, innovation).
        

### 1.3 Research Foundations of OB

- **Systematic Study**: Analyzing relationships, attributing causes/effects, and drawing conclusions based on scientific evidence (opposed to intuition alone).
    
- **Evidence-Based Management (EBM)**: Basing managerial decisions on the best available scientific evidence (reduces reliance on “gut instinct”).
    
- **Big Data & Artificial Intelligence (AI) in OB**:
    
    - Big Data: Extensive statistical compilation/analysis to predict behavior (e.g., employee productivity, turnover).
        
    - AI/Machine Learning: Tools (e.g., robotics, sentiment analysis, mobile sensors) to analyze OB phenomena (e.g., hiring, training, employee engagement).
        

### 1.4 Disciplines Contributing to OB

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Discipline|Focus|Contribution to OB|
|**Psychology**|Individual behavior|Learning, perception, personality, motivation, leadership effectiveness, job satisfaction|
|**Social Psychology**|Group influence on individuals|Attitude change, communication patterns, group behavior, power/conflict|
|**Sociology**|Group/ organizational behavior|Formal organization theory, structure, culture, power, intergroup relations|
|**Anthropology**|Cultural/environmental influences|Cross-cultural differences, organizational culture, climate|

### 1.5 Key OB Challenges & Opportunities

- **Workforce Diversity & Inclusion**: Recognizing/valuing differences (gender, age, race, sexual orientation) and creating environments where all feel included.
    
- **Globalization**: Managing expatriate assignments, cross-cultural teams, and international operations (requires cultural intelligence).
    
- **Technology & Social Media**: Balancing remote work, AI tools, and social media use while mitigating privacy/security risks.
    
- **Ethical Behavior**: Addressing ethical dilemmas (e.g., value misalignment between employees and organizations) and reducing unethical conduct (e.g., fraud, discrimination).
    
- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Self-regulated actions to benefit society/environment beyond legal requirements (e.g., sustainability, philanthropy).
    
- **Gig Economy**: Managing independent/contingent workers (e.g., freelancers, contractors) and addressing their unique needs (job insecurity, autonomy).
    
- **OB During Crises**: Adapting to crises (e.g., COVID-19) by managing remote work, stress, and organizational resilience.
    

### 1.6 OB Model (Inputs → Processes → Outcomes)

- **Inputs**: Variables that set the stage for behavior (e.g., individual personality/values, group structure, organizational culture).
    
- **Processes**: Actions that individuals/groups/organizations engage in (e.g., motivation, communication, leadership, conflict resolution).
    
- **Outcomes**: Key variables to explain/predict (individual: job satisfaction, performance, citizenship behavior, withdrawal; group: team performance; organizational: productivity, survival).

## Chapter 2: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations

### 2.1 Forms of Workplace Diversity

- **Surface-Level Diversity**: Visible differences (age, gender, race, ethnicity) that may trigger stereotypes but do not reflect deep-level traits (e.g., a young Black employee vs. an older Hispanic employee).
    
- **Deep-Level Diversity**: Invisible differences (values, personality, work preferences) that become more relevant as people interact (e.g., shared work styles or time management habits).
    
- **Biographical Characteristics** (surface-level markers):
    
    - **Race/Ethnicity**: Race = heritage identity; Ethnicity = cultural characteristics (e.g., language, customs). Discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities (e.g., hiring bias, pay gaps) undermines equity.
        
    - **Age**: Older workers bring experience/judgment; younger workers bring tech proficiency. Ageism (prejudice against older/younger workers) reduces organizational effectiveness.
        
    - **Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation**: Gender identity = deeply held sense of gender (may not match sex at birth); sexual orientation = enduring attraction patterns. LGBTQ+ employees face unique barriers (e.g., workplace discrimination, glass ceiling).
        

### 2.2 Prejudice & Discrimination

- **Prejudice**: An attitude (positive/negative) toward a group or its members that maintains hierarchy (e.g., sexism, racism, ageism).
    
- **Implicit Bias**: Prejudice hidden outside conscious awareness (measured via tools like the Implicit Association Test [IAT]).
    
- **Discrimination**: Actions that create/maintain group advantages (e.g., exclusion, harassment, unequal pay).
    
    - **Disparate Impact**: Unintentional discriminatory effect of neutral employment practices (e.g., a hiring test that disproportionately excludes a protected group).
        
    - **Disparate Treatment**: Intentional discrimination (e.g., refusing to hire qualified women for leadership roles).
        
- **Microaggressions**: Subtle, automatic exchanges that harm marginalized groups (e.g., microinsults, microinvalidations).
    

### 2.3 Theoretical Perspectives on Diversity

- **Social Categorization**: People group others into “ingroups” (similar to self) and “outgroups” (different from self), leading to ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation (fractures teams).
    
- **Stereotyping**: Judging someone based on group membership (e.g., “women are less assertive” in leadership roles).
    
    - **Stereotype Threat**: Fear of being judged by a negative stereotype (e.g., an older worker worrying they are seen as “out of touch”).
        
    - **Stigma**: Concealable attributes devalued in social contexts (e.g., LGBTQ+ identity, prior incarceration).
        
- **System Justification Theory**: Group members accept/rationalize inequality (e.g., marginalized employees justifying lower pay as “normal”).
    
- **Social Dominance Theory**: Prejudice stems from hierarchy (dominant groups enjoy privilege; social dominance orientation [SDO] = desire for group hierarchy).
    
- **Intersectionality**: Identities (e.g., race + gender + class) interact to shape experiences (e.g., Black women face “double jeopardy” of racism and sexism).
    
- **Cultural Mosaic**: Individuals are composed of overlapping “tiles” (demographic, geographic, associative traits) that influence workplace interactions.
    

### 2.4 Diversity Dynamics in Groups

- **Group Composition**:
    
    - Surface-level diversity increases early conflict but can improve creativity over time.
        
    - Deep-level diversity (values/opinions) fuels task conflict but can enhance problem-solving if managed well.
        
    - Functional diversity (skills/abilities) boosts team performance/innovation (e.g., cross-functional project teams).
        
- **Fault Lines**: Perceived divisions splitting groups into subgroups (e.g., by race, gender, or work experience) that reduce cohesion and performance.
    

### 2.5 Cross-Cultural OB

- **Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions**:
    
    - **Power Distance**: Acceptance of unequal power distribution (high = Malaysia; low = Austria).
        
    - **Individualism vs. Collectivism**: Focus on individual rights (high = U.S.) vs. group loyalty (high = Guatemala).
        
    - **Masculinity vs. Femininity**: Preference for traditional gender roles (high = Japan) vs. gender equality (high = Sweden).
        
    - **Uncertainty Avoidance**: Tolerance for ambiguity (high = Greece; low = Singapore).
        
    - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation**: Focus on future thrift/persistence (high = Hong Kong) vs. past traditions (high = Pakistan).
        
- **GLOBE Framework**: Expands Hofstede with 9 dimensions (e.g., humane orientation, performance orientation) and differentiates between _values_ (ideal) and _practices_ (actual behavior).
    
- **Cultural Tightness-Looseness**: Degree of norm clarity and tolerance for deviation (tight = Japan; loose = U.S.).
    
- **Cultural Intelligence (CQ)**: Ability to function effectively in culturally diverse settings (critical for expatriates and global teams).
    

### 2.6 Diversity Management

- **Diversity Management**: Evidence-based strategies to leverage workforce diversity (focus on _diversity, equity, and inclusion [DEI]_).
    
    - **Equity**: Ensuring equal access to opportunities (addresses systemic barriers).
        
    - **Inclusion**: Creating environments where all feel valued and can contribute fully.
        
- **Key Practices**:
    
    - **Common Ingroup Identity**: Reframing “us vs. them” to “we” (unites diverse groups).
        
    - **Contact Hypothesis**: Increased interaction reduces prejudice (e.g., cross-race mentorship programs).
        
    - **Diversity Training**: Builds awareness of bias and improves cross-cultural communication.
        
    - **Diversity Culture/Climate**: Shared values (diversity culture) and policies (diversity climate) that prioritize DEI.

## Chapter 3: Job Attitudes

### 3.1 Attitude Components (ABC Model)

- **Cognitive Component**: Belief/opinion about an attitude target (e.g., “My pay is low”).
    
- **Affective Component**: Emotional/feeling segment (e.g., “I am angry about my low pay”).
    
- **Behavioral Component**: Intention to act (e.g., “I will look for a higher-paying job”).
    

### 3.2 Attitude-Behavior Link

- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Incompatibility between attitudes and behavior (people reduce dissonance by changing attitudes, behavior, or rationalizing the gap).
    
- **Moderators of Attitude-Behavior Consistency**: Attitude importance, social pressure, direct experience, and attitude accessibility.
    

### 3.3 Major Job Attitudes

- **Job Satisfaction**: Positive feeling about a job resulting from evaluating its characteristics (e.g., work itself, pay, supervision).
    
- **Job Involvement**: Degree of psychological identification with one’s job (e.g., seeing work as central to self-worth).
    
- **Organizational Commitment**: Emotional attachment to the organization and desire to remain a member (3 components:
    
    - **Affective Commitment**: Emotional attachment (strongest predictor of retention).
        
    - **Normative Commitment**: Sense of obligation to stay.
        
    - **Continuance Commitment**: Fear of losing investments (e.g., pension, seniority)).
        
- **Perceived Organizational Support (POS)**: Belief that the organization values contributions and cares about well-being (e.g., covering medical expenses for an employee).
    
- **Employee Engagement**: Degree of enthusiasm for one’s job (passion + deep connection to the organization; predicts productivity and retention).
    
- **Organizational Identification**: Defining oneself by the organization’s characteristics (e.g., a “Nvidia employee” or “Starbucks barista”).
    

### 3.4 Measuring Job Satisfaction

- **Single Global Rating**: One-item measure (e.g., “How satisfied are you with your job?” 1=low, 5=high).
    
- **Summation of Job Facets**: Rating key job elements (work itself, pay, promotions, supervision, coworkers) and aggregating scores.
    

### 3.5 Causes & Outcomes of Job Satisfaction

- **Causes**:
    
    - **Job Conditions**: Interesting work, autonomy, social support, and fair supervision (strongest predictors).
        
    - **Personality**: Core self-evaluations (CSEs; belief in one’s worth/competence) and positive affectivity (optimism) boost satisfaction.
        
    - **Pay**: Correlates with satisfaction but has diminishing returns after basic needs are met.
        
- **Positive Outcomes**:
    
    - Higher job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB; voluntary help for coworkers), customer satisfaction, and life satisfaction.
        
- **Responses to Dissatisfaction (Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Neglect Model)**:
    
    - **Exit**: Leave the organization (quit, transfer).
        
    - **Voice**: Actively improve conditions (suggest changes, file grievances).
        
    - **Loyalty**: Passively wait for improvement (defend the organization publicly).
        
    - **Neglect**: Allow conditions to worsen (absenteeism, reduced effort, errors).
        
- **Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB)**: Actions that harm the organization (e.g., theft, gossip, absenteeism) often triggered by job dissatisfaction.

## Chapter 4: Emotions and Moods

### 4.1 Core Definitions

- **Affect**: Broad range of feelings (includes emotions and moods).
    
- **Emotions**: Intense, discrete, short-lived feelings caused by specific events (e.g., anger, joy, fear).
    
- **Moods**: Longer-lived, less intense feelings without a specific trigger (e.g., general happiness, irritability).
    
- **Positive Affect (PA)**: Dimension of positive emotions (excitement, enthusiasm); **Negative Affect (NA)**: Dimension of negative emotions (nervousness, stress).
    
- **Positivity Offset**: Tendency to experience a mildly positive mood at “zero input” (no specific events occurring).
    

### 4.2 Types of Emotions

- **Basic Emotions**: Universal emotions (anger, fear, sadness, happiness, disgust, surprise) recognized across cultures.
    
- **Moral Emotions**: Emotions tied to moral judgments (e.g., guilt for unethical acts, anger at injustice).
    

### 4.3 Sources of Emotions & Moods

- **Personality**: Affect intensity (degree of emotional response) and trait affectivity (stable tendency toward PA/NA).
    
- **Time of Day**: PA peaks in late morning, declines in afternoon, and rises again in evening; NA increases over the day.
    
- **Day of Week**: PA is highest on weekends (Friday-Sunday) and lowest on Mondays (in most cultures).
    
- **Weather**: Little effect on mood (illusory correlation).
    
- **Stress**: Negative events (e.g., reprimands, deadlines) increase NA.
    
- **Social Interactions**: Positive interactions boost PA; negative interactions (e.g., conflict) increase NA.
    
- **Sleep/Exercise**: Poor sleep reduces PA; exercise enhances PA and reduces fatigue.
    
- **Gender**: No inherent differences in emotional experience, but stereotypes (e.g., “women are more emotional”) persist in the workplace.
    

### 4.4 Emotional Labor

- **Emotional Labor**: Expending effort to display organizationally desired emotions (e.g., a retail worker smiling at a rude customer).
    
- **Felt vs. Displayed Emotions**:
    
    - **Felt Emotions**: Actual emotions (e.g., frustration with a customer).
        
    - **Displayed Emotions**: Required emotions (e.g., smiling despite frustration).
        
- **Emotion Regulation Strategies**:
    
    - **Surface Acting**: Hiding felt emotions (e.g., faking a smile; linked to stress/exhaustion).
        
    - **Deep Acting**: Modifying felt emotions to match displayed emotions (e.g., reframing a rude customer as “having a bad day”; more sustainable).
        
    - **Emotional Dissonance**: Inconsistency between felt and displayed emotions (causes burnout).
        

### 4.5 Key Theories & Models

- **Affective Events Theory (AET)**: Workplace events trigger emotional reactions, which influence job satisfaction and performance (e.g., a promotion triggers joy, boosting productivity).
    
- **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**: Ability to (1) perceive emotions in self/others, (2) understand emotion meaning, and (3) regulate emotions. EI predicts job performance, leadership effectiveness, and teamwork (measured via tests like MSCEIT).
    

### 4.6 OB Applications of Emotions/Moods

- **Decision Making**: Positive mood enhances creativity; negative mood improves analytical thinking (but can cloud judgment).
    
- **Leadership**: Charismatic leaders use emotional appeals to inspire followers; leader anger can increase effort but risks unethical retaliation.
    
- **Customer Service**: Emotional contagion (catching others’ emotions) means employee positivity boosts customer satisfaction.
    
- **Safety**: Negative moods increase workplace injuries (distraction, anxiety).

## Chapter 5: Personality and Individual Differences

### 5.1 Personality Basics

- **Personality**: Sum of ways an individual reacts to/interacts with the world (measured via self-report or observer-rating surveys).
    
- **Personality Traits**: Enduring characteristics (e.g., conscientiousness, extroversion) that describe behavior across situations.
    

### 5.2 Personality Frameworks

- **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)**: 4-dimensional test (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) that classifies people into 16 types (e.g., INTJ = visionary, stubborn). **Critique**: Lacks empirical validity and forces binary categorization (no “in-between” scores).
    
- **Big Five Model** (most evidence-based framework):
    
    - **Conscientiousness**: Responsible, organized, dependable (strongest predictor of job performance; reduces CWBs).
        
    - **Emotional Stability**: Calm, confident, secure (predicts life/job satisfaction; reduces burnout).
        
    - **Extroversion**: Sociable, assertive, gregarious (predicts leadership emergence; boosts career success).
        
    - **Openness to Experience**: Creative, curious, innovative (predicts adaptability to change; enhances creativity).
        
    - **Agreeableness**: Cooperative, warm, trusting (improves teamwork; reduces conflict but may lower earnings).
        
- **Dark Triad** (socially undesirable traits):
    
    - **Machiavellianism**: Manipulative, cynical, focused on self-interest (e.g., lying to gain power).
        
    - **Narcissism**: Arrogant, entitled, attention-seeking (common in leaders but linked to unethical behavior).
        
    - **Psychopathy**: Lack of empathy, impulsive, callous (rare but harmful in leadership roles).
        

### 5.3 Other Personality Attributes

- **Core Self-Evaluations (CSEs)**: Fundamental judgments of self-worth/competence (high CSEs = higher job satisfaction/performance).
    
- **Self-Monitoring**: Ability to adjust behavior to fit situational norms (high self-monitors = better at impression management).
    
- **Proactive Personality**: Tendency to take initiative and create change (predicts career success and innovation).
    

### 5.4 Situation-Personality Interaction

- **Situation Strength Theory**: Strong situations (clear norms/rules) constrain personality expression (e.g., a military base); weak situations (ambiguous norms) allow personality to drive behavior (e.g., a startup).
    
- **Trait Activation Theory**: Situations “activate” relevant traits (e.g., a leadership role activates extroversion).
    

### 5.5 Ability & Values

- **Ability**: Capacity to perform tasks (**Intellectual Abilities**: cognitive skills like reasoning; **Physical Abilities**: strength, stamina).
    
- **Values**: Stable beliefs about desirable end states (**Terminal Values**: end goals like happiness; **Instrumental Values**: means to goals like honesty).
    

### 5.6 Person-Environment Fit

- **Person-Job Fit**: Matching personality to job requirements (Holland’s Theory: 6 types—Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional).
    
- **Person-Organization Fit**: Matching values/personality to organizational culture (predicts retention and job satisfaction).

## Chapter 6: Perception and Individual Decision Making

### 6.1 Perception Basics

- **Perception**: Process of interpreting sensory information to understand the environment (influenced by perceiver, target, and situation).
    
- **Factors Influencing Perception**:
    
    - **Perceiver**: Attitudes, motives, experience, expectations.
        
    - **Target**: Novelty, motion, sound, size, background.
        
    - **Situation**: Time, work setting, social context.
        

### 6.2 Person Perception

- **Attribution Theory**: Explains how people attribute others’ behavior to internal (dispositional) or external (situational) causes (3 cues:
    
    - **Distinctiveness**: Behavior varies across situations (high = external cause).
        
    - **Consensus**: Others behave similarly (high = external cause).
        
    - **Consistency**: Behavior is stable over time (high = internal cause)).
        
- **Fundamental Attribution Error**: Overattributing others’ behavior to internal causes (e.g., blaming a late employee for laziness instead of a traffic jam).
    
- **Self-Serving Bias**: Attributing one’s success to internal causes and failure to external causes.
    
- **Shortcuts in Judging Others**:
    
    - **Selective Perception**: Focusing on information that confirms expectations (e.g., a manager noticing only a subordinate’s mistakes).
        
    - **Halo/Horns Effect**: Generalizing a single positive/negative trait to the entire person (e.g., a “friendly” employee is seen as competent).
        
    - **Stereotyping**: Judging someone by group membership (e.g., “older workers are tech-illiterate”).
        
    - **Contrast Effect**: Evaluating someone relative to recent comparisons (e.g., a mediocre candidate seems strong after a weak one).
        

### 6.3 Decision Making

- **Rational Model**: Ideal decision-making process (define problem, identify criteria, weight criteria, generate alternatives, select optimal solution).
    
- **Bounded Rationality**: Limited rationality due to time/cognitive constraints (people “satisfice” instead of optimizing).
    
- **Intuition**: Gut feeling based on experience (complements rational decision making).
    
- **Common Biases/Errors**:
    
    - **Overconfidence**: Overestimating decision accuracy (e.g., a manager overestimating a project’s success).
        
    - **Anchoring**: Fixating on initial information (e.g., a salary negotiation anchored on a low offer).
        
    - **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs (ignoring contradictory evidence).
        
    - **Availability Bias**: Overrelying on easily accessible information (e.g., overestimating risks from recent news).
        
    - **Escalation of Commitment**: Continuing to invest in a failing decision (e.g., pouring money into a failing project).
        

### 6.4 Ethics in Decision Making

- **Ethical Decision Criteria**:
    
    - **Utilitarianism**: Maximize overall good (e.g., layoffs to save the company).
        
    - **Rights**: Protect individual rights (e.g., privacy, free speech).
        
    - **Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits/harm (e.g., equal pay for equal work).
        
- **Behavioral Ethics**: How people actually make ethical decisions (often influenced by situational factors, not just values).
    

### 6.5 Creativity & Innovation

- **Creative Behavior**: Generating novel/useful ideas (requires creative potential and a supportive environment).
    
- **Innovation**: Implementing creative ideas (depends on team collaboration and organizational support).

## Chapter 7: Motivation Concepts

### 7.1 Motivation Definition

- **Motivation**: Processes that account for an individual’s intensity, direction, and persistence of effort toward a goal.
    

### 7.2 Classic Motivation Theories

- **Hierarchy of Needs Theory (Maslow)**: People satisfy needs in order (physiological → safety → social → esteem → self-actualization). **Critique**: Needs do not always follow a strict hierarchy.
    
- **Two-Factor Theory (Herzberg)**:
    
    - **Hygiene Factors**: Job context factors (pay, supervision) that prevent dissatisfaction (but do not motivate).
        
    - **Motivators**: Job content factors (achievement, recognition) that drive motivation and satisfaction.
        
- **McClelland’s Theory of Needs**:
    
    - **Need for Achievement (nAch)**: Desire to excel (high in entrepreneurs).
        
    - **Need for Power (nPow)**: Desire to influence others (high in leaders).
        
    - **Need for Affiliation (nAff)**: Desire for close relationships (high in team players).
        

### 7.3 Contemporary Motivation Theories

#### Content-Based Theories (Focus on Needs)

- **Self-Determination Theory**: People seek autonomy, competence, and relatedness (intrinsic motivation is stronger than extrinsic).
    
- **Regulatory Focus Theory**:
    
    - **Promotion Focus**: Striving for gains (e.g., achieving a promotion).
        
    - **Prevention Focus**: Avoiding losses (e.g., avoiding a demotion).
        
- **Job Engagement Theory**: Engagement (passion for work) is driven by meaningful work, autonomy, and social support.
    

#### Context-Based Theories (Focus on Environment)

- **Reinforcement Theory**: Behavior is shaped by consequences (positive reinforcement = reward desired behavior; punishment = reduce unwanted behavior).
    
- **Social Learning Theory**: People learn by observing others (modeling) and imitating successful behavior (e.g., a new employee copying a top performer).
    

#### Process-Based Theories (Focus on Decision Making)

- **Expectancy Theory (Vroom)**: Motivation depends on 3 beliefs:
    
    - **Expectancy**: Effort → performance (e.g., “I can meet the sales target”).
        
    - **Instrumentality**: Performance → rewards (e.g., “Meeting the target leads to a bonus”).
        
    - **Valence**: Reward value (e.g., “I value the bonus”).
        
- **Goal-Setting Theory (Locke)**: Specific, challenging goals (with feedback) boost performance (e.g., “Increase sales by 10% in Q4”).
    
- **Self-Efficacy Theory (Bandura)**: Belief in one’s ability to perform a task (high self-efficacy = higher motivation; can be boosted via mastery experiences or role models).
    

### 7.4 Organizational Justice

- **Equity Theory (Adams)**: People compare their input-output ratio to others’ (inequity causes tension; people may adjust inputs/outputs to restore equity).
    
- **Distributive Justice**: Fairness of outcome distribution (e.g., pay, promotions).
    
- **Procedural Justice**: Fairness of decision-making processes (e.g., transparent promotion criteria).
    
- **Interactional Justice**: Fairness of interpersonal treatment (e.g., respectful communication from managers).

## Chapter 8: Motivation: From Concepts to Applications

### 8.1 Job Design

- **Job Characteristics Model (JCM)**: 5 core job dimensions drive motivation:
    
    - **Skill Variety**: Range of skills used (e.g., a nurse doing patient care and administration).
        
    - **Task Identity**: Completing a whole task (e.g., building a entire chair vs. just a leg).
        
    - **Task Significance**: Impact of work on others (e.g., a teacher shaping students’ lives).
        
    - **Autonomy**: Freedom to schedule/perform work (e.g., a remote worker setting their own hours).
        
    - **Feedback**: Information about performance (e.g., customer reviews for a salesperson).
        
- **Job Redesign Strategies**:
    
    - **Job Rotation**: Moving employees between tasks (reduces boredom).
        
    - **Job Enrichment**: Adding motivators (e.g., decision-making authority) to a job.
        
    - **Relational Job Design**: Connecting work to others (e.g., a product designer meeting end-users).
        

### 8.2 Alternative Work Arrangements

- **Flextime**: Flexible work hours (e.g., 7am-3pm instead of 9am-5pm).
    
- **Job Sharing**: Two employees splitting one full-time job.
    
- **Telecommuting**: Working remotely (e.g., from home or a co-working space; boosted by COVID-19).
    

### 8.3 Employee Involvement

- **Employee Involvement Programs (EIPs)**: Giving employees input into decisions (e.g., quality circles, participative management) to boost motivation and commitment.
    

### 8.4 Rewards & Benefits

- **Pay Structures**:
    
    - **Variable-Pay Programs**: Pay tied to performance (e.g., piece-rate pay, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock options).
        
    - **Pay Secrecy**: Policies restricting pay discussion (can reduce trust and motivation).
        
- **Flexible Benefits**: Customizable benefit packages (e.g., choosing between extra vacation or a retirement contribution).
    
- **Intrinsic Rewards**: Non-monetary rewards (e.g., recognition, meaningful work) that boost intrinsic motivation.

## Chapter 9: Foundations of Group Behavior

### 9.1 Group Definitions & Stages

- **Group**: Two or more individuals interacting interdependently to achieve a goal.
    
- **Social Identity**: Defining oneself by group membership (e.g., “I am part of the marketing team”).
    
- **Tuckman’s Group Development Stages**:
    
    - **Forming**: Orientation and uncertainty (members get to know each other).
        
    - **Storming**: Conflict and power struggles (disagreements about roles/goals).
        
    - **Norming**: Cohesion and consensus (developing group norms).
        
    - **Performing**: High performance (focus on goal achievement).
        
    - **Adjourning**: Disbanding (completing the task and wrapping up).
        

### 9.2 Group Properties

- **Roles**: Expected behaviors for group members (role perception = one’s view of their role; role expectations = others’ views; role conflict = conflicting role demands).
    
- **Norms**: Unwritten rules guiding behavior (e.g., “be on time to meetings”; norms can be positive or negative, like “slacking off is acceptable”).
    
- **Status**: Hierarchical position in the group (high-status members have more influence; status inequity causes conflict).
    
- **Size**: Small groups (≤5) are better for interaction; large groups (≥10) are better for task completion (but suffer from social loafing = reduced effort in large groups).
    
- **Cohesion**: Degree of group member attraction (high cohesion boosts performance if aligned with organizational goals).
    

### 9.3 Group Decision Making

- **Group vs. Individual Decision Making**: Groups have more information and creativity but suffer from groupthink and groupshift.
    
    - **Groupthink**: Conformity to group norms at the expense of critical thinking (e.g., a team ignoring warnings about a project’s risks).
        
    - **Groupshift**: Group decisions becoming more extreme (riskier or more conservative) than individual decisions.
        
- **Group Decision-Making Techniques**:
    
    - **Brainstorming**: Generating ideas without criticism (reduces evaluation apprehension).
        
    - **Nominal Group Technique**: Silent idea generation, followed by discussion and voting (balances individual and group input).
        
    - **Delphi Technique**: Anonymous input from experts (no face-to-face interaction; useful for complex decisions).

## Chapter 10: Understanding Work Teams

### 10.1 Groups vs. Teams

- **Group**: Individuals sharing resources to achieve individual goals (e.g., a department where members work independently).
    
- **Team**: Individuals with complementary skills working interdependently to achieve a shared goal (e.g., a project team designing a new product).
    

### 10.2 Types of Teams

- **Problem-Solving Teams**: Employees from the same department solving work-related issues (e.g., a quality improvement team).
    
- **Self-Managed Work Teams**: Teams with authority to plan/complete tasks (e.g., a manufacturing team scheduling its own shifts).
    
- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Members from different departments (e.g., marketing, engineering, sales) working on a common goal (e.g., launching a new product).
    
- **Virtual Teams**: Teams that interact via technology (e.g., remote teams; require clear communication and trust).
    
- **Multiteam Systems**: Networks of teams working on related tasks (e.g., multiple project teams in a software company).
    

### 10.3 Creating Effective Teams (Team Effectiveness Model)

- **Team Context**:
    
    - **Leadership**: Supportive, empowering leaders (critical for virtual teams).
        
    - **Structure**: Clear roles, goals, and rewards (team-based rewards boost collaboration).
        
    - **Resources**: Access to tools, information, and training.
        
    - **Climate of Trust**: Psychological safety (members feel safe to share ideas/take risks).
        
- **Team Composition**:
    
    - **Abilities**: Complementary skills (e.g., technical and interpersonal skills).
        
    - **Personality**: High conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability (boosts cohesion).
        
    - **Diversity**: Surface-level diversity (race/gender) can boost creativity; deep-level diversity (values) can cause conflict.
        
    - **Size**: Small teams (5-9 members) balance interaction and productivity.
        
- **Team Processes**:
    
    - **Communication**: Open, frequent communication (critical for virtual teams).
        
    - **Conflict**: Task conflict (disagreements about work) is constructive; relationship conflict (personal disagreements) is destructive.
        
    - **Collective Efficacy**: Team belief in its ability to succeed (boosts performance).
        
    - **Reflexivity**: Team reflection on goals and processes (improves adaptability).
        

### 10.4 Team Building

- **Selection**: Hiring employees with teamwork skills (e.g., communication, collaboration).
    
- **Training**: Building team skills (e.g., conflict resolution, cross-cultural communication).
    
- **Rewards**: Recognizing team performance (not just individual performance).

## Chapter 11: Communication

### 11.1 Communication Process

- **Communication**: Transfer and understanding of meaning (key components: sender, message, channel, receiver, feedback, noise).
    
- **Noise**: Factors that distort communication (e.g., language barriers, distractions, emotional bias).
    

### 11.2 Communication Methods

- **Oral Communication**: Verbal exchange (meetings, phone calls; fast but prone to misinterpretation).
    
- **Written Communication**: Documents, emails, reports (permanent but slower).
    
- **Nonverbal Communication**: Body language, facial expressions, tone of voice (conveys emotions and context; e.g., a smile vs. a frown during a feedback session).
    
- **Active Listening**: Focusing on, understanding, and responding to a speaker (reduces miscommunication; key skills: paraphrasing, asking questions).
    

### 11.3 Virtual Communication

- **Videoconferencing**: Real-time visual/audio communication (e.g., Zoom, Teams; critical for remote teams).
    
- **Blogging/Vlogging/Podcasting**: Sharing information via digital platforms (e.g., internal blogs for company updates).
    
- **Social Media**: Platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) for internal/external communication (risks: cyberbullying, information leaks).
    

### 11.4 Cross-Cultural Communication

- **Cultural Context**:
    
    - **High-Context Cultures**: Communication relies on context (e.g., Japan; nonverbal cues are critical).
        
    - **Low-Context Cultures**: Communication is explicit (e.g., U.S.; words are primary).
        
- **Barriers**: Language differences, nonverbal misinterpretation, cultural values (e.g., directness vs. indirectness).
    
- **Guidelines**: Use simple language, avoid jargon, be mindful of nonverbal cues, and seek feedback.
    

### 11.5 Cybersecurity & Communication Ethics

- **Cybersecurity**: Protecting digital communication from breaches (e.g., phishing, hacking; critical for remote work).
    
- **Cyberbullying/Harassment**: Online mistreatment (managers must address it promptly to maintain trust).
    

---

## Chapter 12: Leadership

### 12.1 Leadership Definitions

- **Leadership**: Ability to influence a group toward achieving a vision or goal (distinguished from management: leadership = “doing the right thing”; management = “doing things right”).
    

### 12.2 Trait Theories

- **Early Trait Theories**: Focused on innate traits (e.g., height, intelligence) that predict leadership (largely discredited).
    
- **Modern Trait Theories**:
    
    - **Big Five Traits**: Extroversion (strongest predictor), conscientiousness, openness, emotional stability, and agreeableness (moderate predictor).
        
    - **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**: Critical for leadership (EI leaders build trust and inspire followers).
        
    - **Dark Triad Traits**: Narcissism can help leaders emerge but harms team performance.
        

### 12.3 Behavioral Theories

- **Ohio State Studies**: Two core leadership behaviors:
    
    - **Initiating Structure**: Defining roles, setting goals, and organizing work (task-oriented).
        
    - **Consideration**: Building trust, supporting employees, and showing concern (people-oriented).
        
- **University of Michigan Studies**: Two leadership styles:
    
    - **Employee-Oriented**: Focus on employee needs and development (high group productivity).
        
    - **Production-Oriented**: Focus on task completion (low group productivity).
        
- **Blake & Mouton’s Managerial Grid**: Evaluates leaders on concern for people (y-axis) and concern for production (x-axis); the “team management” style (high-high) is most effective.
    

### 12.4 Contingency Theories

- **Fiedler Model**: Leadership effectiveness depends on leader style (task-oriented vs. relationship-oriented) and situational favorableness (leader-member relations, task structure, position power).
    
- **Situational Leadership Theory (SLT)**: Leaders adjust style to follower readiness (ability/willingness):
    
    - **Telling**: High task, low relationship (for unready followers).
        
    - **Selling**: High task, high relationship (for willing but unskilled followers).
        
    - **Participating**: Low task, high relationship (for skilled but unwilling followers).
        
    - **Delegating**: Low task, low relationship (for ready followers).
        
- **Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Theory**: Leaders form “in-groups” (trusted followers) and “out-groups” (peripheral followers); in-group members have higher performance and satisfaction.
    

### 12.5 Transformational & Charismatic Leadership

- **Charismatic Leadership**: Leaders who inspire via vision, passion, and personal appeal (e.g., Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs). Charismatic leaders have high confidence, dominance, and a strong vision.
    
- **Transformational Leadership**: Leaders who inspire followers to transcend self-interest for the organization’s good (4 components:
    
    - **Idealized Influence**: Role modeling ethical behavior (charisma).
        
    - **Inspirational Motivation**: Communicating a compelling vision.
        
    - **Intellectual Stimulation**: Encouraging creativity and innovation.
        
    - **Individualized Consideration**: Coaching and developing followers).
        
- **Transactional Leadership**: Leaders who reward/punish based on performance (focus on maintaining the status quo; less effective than transformational for long-term change).
    
- **Authentic Leadership**: Leaders who are genuine, transparent, and aligned with their values (builds trust and ethical behavior).
    
- **Servant Leadership**: Leaders who prioritize followers’ needs (e.g., empowering employees to grow; linked to team performance and satisfaction).
    

### 12.6 Leadership Challenges

- **Leading in Crises**: Crisis leaders need decisiveness, empathy, and clear communication (e.g., COVID-19 response).
    
- **Shared Leadership**: Distributing leadership across team members (critical for self-managed teams).
    
- **Global Leadership**: Leading cross-cultural teams (requires cultural intelligence and adaptability).
    

---

## Chapter 13: Power and Politics

### 13.1 Power Definitions

- **Power**: Ability to influence others’ behavior (even against their will; distinguished from leadership: power = potential to influence; leadership = influence to achieve a goal).
    
- **Dependency**: Key to power (A has power over B if B depends on A for resources; dependency increases with resource importance, scarcity, and nonsubstitutability).
    

### 13.2 Bases of Power

- **Formal Power** (position-based):
    
    - **Coercive Power**: Threats/punishments (e.g., firing an employee for poor performance).
        
    - **Reward Power**: Ability to give rewards (e.g., bonuses, promotions).
        
    - **Legitimate Power**: Formal authority (e.g., a manager’s right to assign tasks).
        
- **Personal Power** (individual-based):
    
    - **Expert Power**: Specialized knowledge/skill (e.g., a software engineer’s expertise in coding).
        
    - **Referent Power**: Attraction/identification (e.g., a charismatic leader’s influence).
        

### 13.3 Power Tactics (Influence Strategies)

- **Legitimacy**: Using formal authority (e.g., “I’m the manager; this is the rule”).
    
- **Rational Persuasion**: Using logic/facts (e.g., “This plan will increase profits by 10%”).
    
- **Inspirational Appeals**: Appealing to values/emotions (e.g., “This project will help our community”).
    
- **Consultation**: Asking for input (e.g., “What do you think of this idea?”).
    
- **Exchange**: Offering rewards (e.g., “I’ll support your project if you support mine”).
    
- **Personal Appeals**: Using friendship (e.g., “Can you help me with this favor?”).
    
- **Ingratiation**: Flattering others (e.g., “You’re the best at this; can you help?”).
    
- **Pressure**: Using threats/demands (e.g., “You must finish this by Friday”).
    
- **Coalitions**: Enlisting others’ support (e.g., “The team agrees this is the right approach”).
    

### 13.4 Politics in Organizations

- **Organizational Politics**: Activities to gain/use power (e.g., networking, lobbying for resources).
    
- **Political Behavior**: Actions not required by formal role but intended to influence others (e.g., currying favor with a manager).
    
- **Causes of Political Behavior**: Ambiguous goals, limited resources, and high performance pressure.
    
- **Responses to Politics**:
    
    - **Exit**: Leaving the organization.
        
    - **Voice**: Speaking up about unfair politics.
        
    - **Loyalty**: Ignoring politics and focusing on work.
        
    - **Neglect**: Reducing effort (e.g., absenteeism).
        
- **Impression Management**: Shaping others’ perceptions (e.g., dressing professionally, taking credit for successes; common in interviews and promotions).
    

### 13.5 Power & Ethics

- **Sexual Harassment**: Abuse of power (unwanted sexual advances or hostile work environment; illegal and unethical).
    
- **Ethical Power Use**: Power should be used to benefit the organization, not just self-interest (abusive supervision = using power to harm subordinates, linked to CWBs and turnover).
    

---

## Chapter 14: Conflict and Negotiation

### 14.1 Conflict Definitions

- **Conflict**: Perceived incompatibility of goals, values, or interests between parties (can be functional or dysfunctional).
    
    - **Functional Conflict**: Constructive conflict that improves performance (e.g., task conflict about project design).
        
    - **Dysfunctional Conflict**: Destructive conflict that harms performance (e.g., relationship conflict between team members).
        

### 14.2 Conflict Process

1. **Stage 1: Potential Opposition/Incompatibility**: Sources of conflict (communication barriers, structural issues like task interdependence, personal differences like personality clashes).
    
2. **Stage 2: Cognition & Personalization**: Perceiving and feeling conflict (emotional involvement turns potential conflict into actual conflict).
    
3. **Stage 3: Intentions**: Decisions about how to respond (5 conflict-handling intentions:
    
    1. **Competing**: Assertive, uncooperative (win-lose; e.g., a manager forcing a decision).
        
    2. **Collaborating**: Assertive, cooperative (win-win; e.g., finding a mutually beneficial solution).
        
    3. **Compromising**: Moderate assertiveness/cooperation (split the difference; e.g., a salary negotiation).
        
    4. **Avoiding**: Unassertive, uncooperative (ignore conflict; e.g., avoiding a confrontation).
        
    5. **Accommodating**: Unassertive, cooperative (yield to others; e.g., agreeing to a team member’s idea)).
        
4. **Stage 4: Behavior**: Observable conflict actions (e.g., arguments, threats, or collaborative problem-solving).
    
5. **Stage 5: Outcomes**: Functional (improved creativity, better decisions) or dysfunctional (reduced cohesion, lower performance).
    

### 14.3 Negotiation

- **Negotiation**: Process of reaching an agreement between parties with different preferences (e.g., salary, contract terms).
    
- **Bargaining Strategies**:
    
    - **Distributive Bargaining**: Fixed-pie negotiation (one party gains at the other’s expense; e.g., haggling over a car price). Key tactics: anchoring, setting a reservation point (minimum acceptable outcome).
        
    - **Integrative Bargaining**: Expanding-pie negotiation (both parties gain; e.g., a company and union agreeing to productivity bonuses that benefit both). Key tactics: sharing information, focusing on common goals.
        

### 14.4 Negotiation Process

1. **Preparation & Planning**: Define goals, research the other party, and set a reservation point.
    
2. **Ground Rules**: Establish negotiation parameters (e.g., time, location, issues to discuss).
    
3. **Clarification & Justification**: Share positions and explain reasoning.
    
4. **Bargaining & Problem-Solving**: Make offers/counteroffers (integrative bargaining requires creativity).
    
5. **Closure & Implementation**: Finalize the agreement and outline next steps.
    

### 14.5 Individual Differences in Negotiation

- **Personality**: Extraverts and agreeable individuals are less effective in distributive bargaining (too cooperative); conscientious individuals are more effective in integrative bargaining (detail-oriented).
    
- **Moods/Emotions**: Positive mood boosts creativity (integrative bargaining); anger can be effective in distributive bargaining (but risks damaging relationships).
    
- **Culture**: Collectivistic cultures prefer integrative bargaining (focus on relationships); individualistic cultures prefer distributive bargaining (focus on individual gains).
    
- **Gender**: Women are often more cooperative in negotiations but can be as effective as men with training.
    

### 14.6 Ethics in Negotiation

- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Lying about reservation points, hiding information, or making false promises (can damage trust and long-term relationships).
    
- **Third-Party Negotiation**: Using a mediator (facilitates communication), arbitrator (imposes a decision), or conciliator (builds relationships) to resolve impasses.

## Situational Question

### **Introduction**  
During our project on the multi-generational workforce, our team of five encountered significant challenges, exacerbated by the sudden shift to virtual collaboration due to our professor’s unexpected illness. While we ultimately completed the project, the process revealed core OB issues. I will analyze these through the lenses of **individual/group dynamics** and **values/leadership**.

---

### **Area 1: Individual Level and Group Level Concepts**

#### **1. Problems and Difficulties Encountered**

- **Individual Level (Motivation - A MARS Model Factor):** A critical problem was the varying levels of **intrinsic motivation** among members. One member, passionate about the topic of ageism, was highly engaged from the start. In contrast, two others displayed low task motivation, often submitting work late, missing synchronous brainstorming sessions, and contributing minimal effort during the initial research phase. This created an uneven distribution of workload.
    
- **Group Level (Informal Leadership & Cohesion):** With no formally appointed leader, we experienced a **vacuum in informal leadership**, especially after consultations were delayed. Initially, we operated as a loose collective, but as deadlines loomed and pressure mounted, this lack of clear direction led to confusion over roles ("Role Perceptions" in MARS) and inefficient processes. Furthermore, the sudden shift to a fully virtual final presentation damaged our **group cohesion**. The lack of in-person meetings made it difficult to build rapport, leading to transactional communication focused solely on task division, which increased frustration.
    

#### **2. Why These Problems Occurred**

- **Individual Motivation Disparity:** According to the **MARS model**, individual behavior is a function of Motivation, Ability, Role Perceptions, and Situational Factors. Here, the **Situational Factor** of the professor’s illness and the project's pivot to a recorded format acted as a demotivator for some. The perceived reduction in accountability (no live presentation) and the ambiguity created by delayed guidelines likely lowered the **intensity and persistence of effort** for those less intrinsically connected to the topic. Their personal value systems (perhaps prioritizing other courses or commitments) clashed with the team's immediate needs.
    
- **Leadership Vacuum & Eroded Cohesion:** From the **group-level perspective**, the absence of both formal guidance (from the professor) and emergent informal leadership within our team meant we lacked the "motivational ability" that leaders provide. As the course notes, _informal leaders emerge due to skills/talents_. In our initial meetings, no one stepped up to organize, motivate, and clarify roles. The virtual environment further acted as a barrier to the spontaneous, trust-building interactions necessary for cohesion. We became a group in name but struggled to act as a coordinated team.
    

#### **3. Suggestions for Improvement**

- **To Address Motivation Disparity:** Early in the project, we should have explicitly discussed the **MARS model** factors as a team. A contract setting clear expectations (Role Perceptions) and regular, short check-ins (a positive Situational Factor to increase accountability) could have been established. Recognizing the different **values** (e.g., learning vs. just grade-getting), we could have connected each member’s personal interests to specific parts of the project (e.g., letting the data-oriented member handle interview analysis) to enhance intrinsic motivation.
    
- **To Address Leadership & Cohesion:** We needed to proactively encourage the emergence of an **informal leader**. Someone with strong organizational skills could have voluntarily taken on a coordinator role, implementing a shared project plan and facilitating meetings using a **task-oriented leadership style** (setting agendas, deadlines). To build cohesion virtually, we could have dedicated the first 5 minutes of each meeting to non-work chat, mimicking the "water-cooler" interactions lost when in-person classes were canceled.
    

---

### **Area 2: Values and Leadership**

#### **1. Problems and Difficulties Encountered**

- **Values (Espoused vs. Enacted):** Our team **espoused** values of **collaboration, quality, and fairness**. However, **enacted values** often diverged. For example, while everyone agreed quality was important, the rush caused by delayed consultations led some to advocate for "just getting it done," prioritizing speed over depth in our interview analysis. This clash between espoused quality and enacted expediency caused tension.
    
- **Leadership (Lack of Transformational Direction):** Our team management suffered from a complete absence of **transformational leadership**. We had no one to create and communicate a compelling _vision_ for our project beyond the grade. There was no **intellectual stimulation** to push us to think more deeply about our topic, and minimal **individualized consideration** for members who were struggling with the sudden changes. We were purely **transactional**, merely exchanging tasks for outcomes, which felt demoralizing.
    

#### **2. Why These Problems Occurred**

- **Value Incongruence:** The stress induced by the unexpected situational change (professor's illness) acted as a catalyst for value divergence. As per OB concepts, **value incongruence** under stress leads to poor decisions and conflict. The **collectivistic** nature highlighted in Hong Kong's culture (per Hofstede) meant there was an initial desire for harmony, which prevented us from openly addressing the growing gap between what we said we valued and what we did. The lack of a strong unifying purpose made our espoused values fragile.
    
- **Leadership Void in a Crisis:** The **contingency perspective** teaches that the best leadership style depends on the situation. Our situation—characterized by high ambiguity, low structure, and high stress—desperately required **transformational leadership** to provide vision and inspiration, or at least a clear **directive style** (from Path-Goal Theory) to reduce ambiguity. Without any member adopting such a role, we defaulted to a rudimentary, ineffective form of management by exception, only addressing issues when they became crises.
    

#### **3. Suggestions for Improvement**

- **To Align Values:** We should have held a "values calibration" meeting _after_ the project changes were announced. Using the course concept of **espoused vs. enacted values**, we could have openly asked: "Given our new constraints, how do we _actually_ enact 'quality' and 'fairness'?" This could have led to a concrete, agreed-upon plan, such as redefining our quality standard for the video presentation or creating a fair rotation for the most tedious tasks.
    
- **To Inject Transformational Leadership:** Even without a formal leader, any team member could have adopted transformational behaviors. For instance, during a meeting, someone could have said: **"Let's not just make another class project. Let's create a guide that could genuinely help a small business in Hong Kong manage their multi-generational team better"** (providing **Charisma & Inspiration**). They could then challenge our assumptions about mature workers (**Intellectual Stimulation**) and check in privately with members who seemed disconnected (**Individualized Consideration**). This would have shifted our focus from a transactional task to a meaningful collective goal, boosting motivation and cohesion.
    

### **Conclusion**  
Our project was a microcosm of organizational challenges, where sudden environmental change amplified underlying issues in motivation, leadership, and values. By applying OB frameworks like the **MARS model**, **informal leadership theory**, **values congruence**, and **transformational leadership**, I can now diagnose the root causes of our difficulties. The key learning is that in times of crisis, proactive attention to group processes and intentional leadership—even informally distributed—is not optional but essential for turning a collection of individuals into an effective, resilient team.
