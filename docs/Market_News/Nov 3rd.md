Comments from Fed members since the meeting show differing views.

As the government shutdown continues, official data is not being released. Scheduled reports that could be delayed include trade data and factory orders figures on Tuesday, weekly jobless claims figures Thursday and monthly jobs data on Friday.

The focus is currently on private-sector reports, notably the ISM surveys on manufacturing activity in October due on Monday.

- [Amazon strikes \$38B deal with OpenAI for Nvidia chips](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-jumps-on-38-billion-deal-with-openai-to-use-hundreds-of-thousands-of-nvidia-chips-145357373.html)

|**Aspect**|**Summary**|
|---|---|
|**Event**|Amazon Web Services (AWS) signs a massive deal with OpenAI.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html)[](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/11/03/openai-and-amazon-sign-38b-deal-for-ai-computing-power/)|
|**Deal Value**|Reported at **$38 billion** over seven years.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html)|
|**Core Offering**|AWS will provide OpenAI with cloud computing capacity, specifically access to "hundreds of thousands" of Nvidia's advanced AI chips.[](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/11/03/openai-and-amazon-sign-38b-deal-for-ai-computing-power/)[](https://www.dnronline.com/associated_press/national/openai-and-amazon-sign-38b-deal-for-ai-computing-power/article_b62635c7-fdc6-5f75-a10d-dee59abdfc22.html)|
|**Key Implication**|OpenAI diversifies its cloud infrastructure, ending Microsoft's status as its exclusive cloud provider.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html)[](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/11/03/openai-and-amazon-sign-38b-deal-for-ai-computing-power/)|
|**Market Reaction**|Amazon's stock **jumped 5%** to a record high following the announcement, adding nearly $140 billion to its market value.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html)|

- **A Strategic Win for AWS**: This deal is a major endorsement of AWS's capabilities in the competitive AI race. By landing OpenAI as a high-profile client, AWS solidifies its position as a key player and directly counters the advantage of rivals like Microsoft.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html) This can strengthen investor confidence in Amazon's long-term growth in the lucrative AI sector.
    
- **The "Compute" Gold Rush**: The core of this deal is not just a software license, but the provision of raw computational power (compute). This highlights a fundamental business model in the AI era: cloud providers like Amazon act as the "picks and shovels" for AI companies, generating massive, recurring revenue by renting out access to expensive, specialized hardware.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html)[](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/11/03/openai-and-amazon-sign-38b-deal-for-ai-computing-power/)
    
- **Diversification as a De-risking Strategy**: OpenAI's move to a multi-cloud strategy with Amazon shows how companies mitigate risk and ensure scalability. For Amazon, this reduces reliance on a single partner; for OpenAI, it guarantees access to the immense computing resources needed for growth without being locked into one vendor.[](https://www.livemint.com/ai/artificial-intelligence/explained-how-amazon-will-benefit-from-38-billion-openai-deal-11762186423687.html) This is a key corporate finance and operational strategy in action.
    
- **Market Sentiment and Valuation**: The stock's sharp positive reaction demonstrates how strategic deals, especially in high-growth areas like AI, can immediately impact a company's market valuation. Investors are betting that the future revenue and strategic positioning from this deal will significantly benefit Amazon's future cash flows.


## Review on META
### Quick Take
Meta’s stock recently dropped sharply (down ~11–12% in late October 2025) after earnings, despite strong revenue growth, because investors were spooked by **soaring AI-related CapEx, a $15.9B tax hit, and guidance for even higher spending in 2026**. Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your horizon: short-term pressure from costs vs. long-term upside from AI-driven advertising and platform dominance.

### Why Meta’s Stock Dropped

- **Earnings Miss on EPS:** Q3 EPS came in at **$1.05 vs. $6.70 expected**, largely due to a one-time **$15.9B tax expense**.
    
- **CapEx Shock:** Management raised 2025 CapEx to **$70–72B**, with more hikes expected in 2026.
    
- **Cost Growth > Revenue Growth:** Revenue rose **26% YoY to $51.2B**, but expenses and CapEx grew even faster, compressing margins.
    
- **Investor Sentiment:** Markets fear Meta is overspending on AI infrastructure (data centers, custom chips) without clear near-term monetization.
### Conclusion
The market is re-rating the stock from a pure "cash cow" to a "speculative tech bet," which increases volatility.
