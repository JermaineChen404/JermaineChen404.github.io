The recent rally has made stocks vulnerable to a pullback, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Ted Pick and other finance bosses told a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to media reports.

Among the risks: trade tensions, bubble worries and trouble in credit markets.

Investors have also been unsettled by indications that the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates again next month.

On Monday, Governor Lisa Cook described the central bank's December meeting as "live." Mary Daly and Austan Goolsbee also said they had open minds as they weighed a slowing labor market against above-target inflation.

Vice Chair Michelle Bowman is due to speak Tuesday.

Meanwhile, if the government shutdown continues through tonight, it will surpass the 35-day record set during Trump's first term.

[Burry Disclose Bets Against Nvidia, Palantir after Bubble Warning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-of-big-short-fame-discloses-bets-against-palantir-and-nvidia-160833044.html)

>[!example] Key Points from the News
>- **Burry’s Positioning:** Through his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, Burry revealed short bets against **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **Palantir (PLTR)**.
>- **Bubble Warning:** He has repeatedly cautioned that AI enthusiasm is inflating valuations beyond reasonable expectations, similar to past tech bubbles.
>- **Market Context:**
>    - Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock soaring on GPU demand.      
 >   - Palantir has rallied on AI software adoption and government contracts.      
>- **Investor Reaction:** Burry’s moves highlight growing concerns that AI equities may be overextended, even as broader markets remain bullish.

## Takeaway
|Metric (as of late 2025)|**Nvidia (NVDA)**|**Palantir (PLTR)**|
|---|---|---|
|Market Cap|~$4.9 trillion|~$471 billion|
|Trailing P/E|**57.7**|**658.1**|
|Forward P/E|**35.1**|**267.7**|
|Price/Sales (P/S)|**29.9**|**127.7**|
|PEG Ratio|~0.98 (growth-adjusted, reasonable)|~7.2 (very stretched)|
|Growth Outlook|Strong near-term EPS growth from AI GPU demand|Revenue growth, but profitability thin; valuation assumes massive future adoption|

- **Nvidia:**
    
    - Valuation is high but _partially justified_ by explosive earnings growth from AI chip demand.
        
    - Forward P/E of ~35 suggests investors expect continued strong growth, but at least earnings are catching up.
        
    - PEG ratio near 1.0 indicates valuation is not wildly out of line with growth.
        
- **Palantir:**
    
    - Valuation is **extreme**: forward P/E above 250 and P/S above 120.
        
    - PEG ratio >7 shows growth expectations are far outpacing realistic earnings delivery.
        
    - Market is pricing Palantir as a _winner-takes-all AI software platform_, which is highly speculative.
