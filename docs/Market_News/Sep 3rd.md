## Dollar Eases Ahead of U.S. Labor Market Data
> [!tips]- Takeaway
> NFP $\to$ employment rate $\to$ Inflation/Deflation $\to$ Interest rate cut $\to$ stock market & US dollar

> [!tip]+ News
> The dollar turned lower after Tuesday's sharp gains as investors awaited key U.S. labor market data. 
   The U.S. job openings and turnover survey at 10 a.m. Eastern time will be closely monitored ahead of the highly anticipated nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.  
   The Federal Reserve is widely expected to resume interest-rate cuts with a 25 basis-points reduction at its September 17 meeting, LSEG data show.  
   Worse-than-expected jobs data that point to a substantial weakening in the economy could prompt markets to anticipate more aggressive rate cuts, however.  
   Fed Gov. Christopher Waller has said he could back a larger cut in September if jobs data signal "substantial weakening."  
   The DXY dollar index fell 0.1% to 98.343.
### What is Nonfarm Payrolls Report?
Nonfarm Payrolls Report: measures the **change in employment** across most sectors of the US economy, excluding farm workers, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees
### Direct Effects on Interest Rate
- A **stronger-than-expected NFP** (e.g., significant job gains, low unemployment, rising wages) may signal economic overheating and inflationary pressures. This could lead the Fed to **delay interest rate cuts** or even consider hikes.
- A **weaker-than-expected NFP** (e.g., low job growth, rising unemployment, stagnant wages) may raise concerns about economic slowdown. This could prompt the Fed to **cut interest rates** to stimulate growth.
### Indirect Effects on Stock Market
- Interest rate $\uparrow$
	- Borrowing costs for investors $\uparrow$
		- Stock prices $\downarrow$
### Interest Rate & US Dollar
- Interest rate $\uparrow$
	- Return (Yield) on dollar-denominated securities (U.S. Treasury bond) $\uparrow$
		- Demand for the dollar to buy these assets $\uparrow$
			- US dollar $\uparrow$

## Stock Futures Rebound But Bond Selloff Deepens
> [!tips]- Takeaway
> Fears of persistent inflation and high government debt $\to$ Selloff in the bond market $\to$ Higher long-term interest rate (yields) $\to$ stock selloff $\to$ short-term stock rebound

> [!tip]+ News
> Stocks looked set to rebound on Wednesday, although investors remained on edge about rising borrowing costs as long-dated bonds extended their recent selloff.  
   Futures tracking the Dow were slipping 15 points, effectively trading flat. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4%, and contracts tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 0.6%.  
  The three blue-chip gauges had all started September–historically the worst month of the year for stocks–in the red, as Wall Street returned from the Labor Day weekend in a risk-off mood. Investors are trying to make sense of the Trump administration’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook, as well as the legal battle the White House is facing to impose tariffs.  
  Global bond markets were also feeling jittery amid fears about a potential flare-up in inflation and governments’ ballooning deficits. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed 4 basis points to 4.30% on Wednesday, and 30-year bond yields rose 4 basis points to just under 5%.  
  Monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover data, due at 10 a.m. Eastern, could also move the market on Wednesday, given they come two days before the August nonfarm payrolls report.  
  The dollar climbed 0.1% against a weighted basket of its peers. Gold futures rose 0.3% to $3,601 an ounce, extending their recent record-breaking run.
  ### The Stock Market's Mixed & Nervous Rebound
  - **Rebound Mentality:** Some investors are "buying the dip," believing the previous day's selloff was overdone.
    
- **Sector Rotation:** The tech-led gain is significant. Technology companies are often seen as **growth stocks**. Their higher valuations are **more sensitive to interest rates** because their value is based on future earnings, which are worth less when discounted by higher rates. The fact they are rebounding the most suggests this is a tactical bounce rather than a shift in overall sentiment.
    
- **"On Edge":** The phrase "investors remained on edge" is crucial. It tells us the rebound is fragile and lacks strong conviction. This isn't a surge of bullish optimism; it's a cautious pause.
### The Core Problem: The Bond Selloff & Rising Yields
 - **Why This is the Key Story:** This is the most important part of the news. Bond markets are often smarter than stock markets. The selloff here is driven by two primary fears:
    
    1. **Inflation Flare-Up:** Investors are worried that inflation might prove more persistent than expected, which would force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates **"higher for longer."**
        
    2. **Ballooning Government Deficits:** The U.S. government is borrowing massive amounts of money to cover its spending. To attract buyers for all this new debt (in the form of Treasury bonds), it may have to offer **higher interest rates**. This increased supply of bonds pushes their price down and their yields up.
        
- **Impact on Stocks:** Higher long-term yields are a direct headwind for stocks:

## Fear Index Eases as Stocks Rebound
> [!tips]- Takeaway
> - VIX as the "fear index"
> - Potential downside risk $\to$  Higher price for put option $\to$ Higher VIX (volatility)

> [!tip]+ News
> The most widely-followed gauge of market fear and uncertainty was edging lower on Wednesday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on course to rebound following the previous session's selloff.  
  The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, fell to 16.9 from 17.2 in early trading. Any reading of below 20 tends to indicate relatively low volatility.  
  Investors were feeling a little calmer following a ruling that Google won't be forced to sell its Chrome browser, which eased some fears about tech valuations. Nvidia shares were also edging higher ahead of the opening bell, putting the chip maker on course to snap a recent losing streak.  
  Volatility could creep up later this week, though. Friday's jobs report looks like the last hurdle that could stop the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates later this month, so investors will probably be feeling on edge until that lands.
## What is VIX
The **VIX is a real-time market index that represents the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility.**
- **It measures _Expected_ Volatility, not Past Volatility:** It uses the prices of options on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to calculate how much traders and investors _expect_ the market to move over the next 30 days.
    
- **It measures _Implied_ Volatility:** The key inputs for the VIX calculation are the **prices of S&P 500 put and call options**. When investors are worried about potential downside risk, they rush to buy put options for protection. This increased demand drives up the price (premium) of those options. Higher option premiums mean higher _implied volatility_, which the VIX captures.
## Benchmark for VIX
- **Low VIX (e.g., below 15-20):** 
- **"Normal" VIX (e.g., ~15-20):** 
- **High VIX (e.g., above 20-25):** 
- **Very High VIX (e.g., above 30-40):**
