## Spotlight of the Week
> [!tips]- Takeaway
> PPI $\to$ CPI $\to$ Inflation $\to$ Fed rate cut

> [!tip]+ News
> This week’s spotlight will be on two key inflation reports: the producer price index (PPI) on Wednesday and the consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday. Together, the data will offer fresh insight into the strength of the economy and should serve as the final test on whether the Fed is on track to deliver a [widely expected rate cut at its September meeting](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-in-focus-as-september-fed-meeting-nears-what-to-watch-this-week-120006808.html)
> The reports follow a [softer-than-expected August jobs print](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-adds-22000-jobs-unemployment-rate-hits-43-in-august-as-labor-market-continues-dramatic-slowdown-153001609.html) that bolstered hopes for easier monetary policy. Investors will be watching closely to see if inflation trends line up with that narrative, potentially clearing the path for stocks to extend their record-setting run.

### CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- The cost-of-living index for the average household.
- The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by **urban consumers for a basket of goods and services**. This basket includes everything from food, rent, and clothing to medical care, transportation, and education.
- The most widely watched indicator of inflation
- Guides the Fed's decision on rate cut
### PPI (Producer Price Index)
- The cost-of-running index for the average businesses
- The PPI measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by **domestic producers for their output**. It tracks prices at the wholesale level, before they reach the consumer.
- a **leading indicator** for CPI. If the prices producers are paying for materials and producing goods are rising, those increased costs are often (but not always) passed on to consumers down the line.
## Inflation rising, Fed looking away
> [!tips]- Takeaway
> Rate cut $\to$ Better employment & More Inflation
> Goals for Fed: Better employment but controlled inflation

> [!tip]+ News
> The Federal Reserve balances a dual mandate that seeks to maximize employment while keeping inflation at 2%.
Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell outlined the likely case for rate cuts, citing weakness in the job market and the risk that the US labor market could rapidly weaken further. Friday's jobs report is a case in point.
But in the week ahead, the central bank is likely to learn it hasn't made all that much progress on the latter part of this mandate.
Economists expect that consumer prices rose 0.3% over the prior month in August and 2.9% over the prior year. Both would mark an uptick in inflation from July and the Fed moving further from its goal.
On a "core" basis, stripping out the more volatile costs of food and gas, which can be impacted by commodities prices, inflation is set to rise 0.3% and 3.1% on a monthly and annual basis. These would match the increases seen in July.
"The July CPI indicated that tariffs are not the only challenge to the Fed finishing its fight against inflation," Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Nicole Cervi wrote in a note on Friday. "Sticky services inflation alongside the rebound in goods prices has stymied the disinflationary trend of the past two years and pushed inflation further from the FOMC's target."
### Tradeoff between Employment and Inflation
- maximize employment 
	- Weakness in the job market as shown in Friday's NFP calls for rate cut
- keeping inflation at 2%
	- expected 0.3% MoM and 2.9% YoY rise in CPI challenge potential rate cut
## Markets Recovering to Start Key Week of Inflation Data for Markets. Stock Futures Rise.

> Stock futures were rising early Monday as investors awaited key inflation data ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September interest-rate decision.  
Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were both 0.2% higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4% in premarket trading. All three major indexes fell Friday after giving up gains as investors weighed expectations of more rate cuts against fears over the economy following August’s weak jobs report.  
The U.S. economy added 22,000 jobs in August, considerably below the 76,500 expected by economists, while the combined numbers for June and July were revised 21,000 lower.    
Traders now see a 67% probability of three rate cuts this year, up from 40% a week ago, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. A September cut is being priced in, the only question for markets appears to be whether it will now be a quarter-point or half-point reduction—the latter is currently given a 10% chance.    
Inflation data this week could go a long way to answering that question—the producer prices index is due to be released Wednesday before the consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday.    
“Our economists believe you’d need to see pretty weak inflation this week to get to that,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said Monday, referring to the chances of a half-point cut.    
Economists expect core CPI to rise 3.1% in August, flat on July’s number, according to FactSet data. The focus is likely to be on what impact tariffs are having on prices.   
“While the FOMC do appear prepared to look-through the ‘one-time shift in price level’ caused by tariffs, inflation data of this ilk will nonetheless prevent anything larger than a 25 basis point cut being delivered later in the month,” Pepperstone strategist Michael Brown wrote.  
Oil prices jumped around 1.5%, with Brent crude futures reaching $66.50 a barrel early Monday, after the OPEC cartel of producers agreed to hike production further at a meeting Sunday.  
The yield on the 10-Year Treasury ticked higher to 4.083% early Monday, while the U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 97.68.
