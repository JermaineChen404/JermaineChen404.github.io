> Nebius stock was soaring on Tuesday after signing a big computing-infrastructure deal with Microsoft. It could be good news for rival CRWV and other peers.
Nebius shares were up 38% at $88.23 in early trading Tuesday after Microsoft agreed to pay the company $17.4 billion for artificial-intelligence infrastructure capacity over the next five years. Shares in peers CoreWeave, and TeraWulf were also rising as shareholders bet on similar deals being struck in future.
Microsoft looks to be turning to Nebius due to constraints in its own cloud-computing business, as big technology companies struggle to acquire enough Nvidia chips to power AI services. Nebius said the computing power will come from its new 300-megawatt data center in Vineland, N.J., starting later this year.
Apart from providing additional capacity, advantages for Microsoft include avoiding recording more capital expenditure—a growing burden for large technology companies—and needing to use its own staff resources to build and manage more data centers. Microsoft may acquire additional services and capacity under the agreement, potentially increasing the value to $19.4 billion.
Normally seeing your biggest customer sign a major deal with a rival operator isn’t good news, but shareholders of CoreWeave look to be concentrating on the prospect of future spending by Microsoft and other big tech companies.
