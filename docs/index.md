## 🎯 About This Blog

Welcome! I am **Chen Hejian (Jermaine)**. This space serves as my digital garden where I synthesize my studies at the intersection of **Finance** and **Operations**. 

Using a combination of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note-taking and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) for publishing, I aim to create a structured, searchable, and mathematically rigorous knowledge base.

### 🛠️ Study Framework
