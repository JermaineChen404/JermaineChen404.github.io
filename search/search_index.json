That outstanding contract revenue drove the company to project that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business will grow 77% to $18 billion in its current fiscal year and soar to $144 billion in 2030. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said the software giant signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the first quarter. While Catz didn't name those customers, she noted that the company has \"significant\" contracts with \"the who's who of AI, including OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), xAI (XAAI.PVT), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and many others.\" The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle signed a $300 billion, five year deal with OpenAI.

Month over month was slightly hotter than expected at 0.4%, compared with expectations for 0.3%. On a headline basis, inflation rose by 2.9% in August, compared with 2.7% in July. \"Despite a slightly firmer gain in the core CPI in August amid broad increases in goods, services and shelter prices, there was not much for the FOMC to fret about,\" Capital Economics economist Stephen Brown said. \"That cements the case for a 25-basis point cut next week, rather than providing any support for a larger 50 basis point move.\" The new reading on consumer prices comes after a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday showed wholesale prices unexpectedly dropped in August and firms took a hit to their margins, implying that businesses are eating tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers. At the same time, data on the jobs market shows softening. Thursday's initial jobless claims, a real-time indicator of the job market, jumped to 263,000, the highest level in four years. And the latest government jobs report showed the economy added 22,000 jobs in August, weaker than the 75,000 economists expected, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% from 4.2%. Job growth for June was revised into negative territory to -13,000 jobs. July showed below-trend growth compared with the past year, marking three months of slowing job growth. The inflation data on Thursday was the last major data point before the Fed's meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Markets are pricing in near certainty for a 25 basis point rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to lowering rates at the end of August in a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., noting that the balance of risks appears to be shifting, which \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\" Former Kansas City Fed president Esther George said she thinks the job market data since Powell's speech corroborates the sense that the labor market is weakening: \"It's softer maybe than we even thought, over the past few months and so,\" George said in an interview. \"I don't think I've heard anyone try to dissuade markets that a 25 basis point cut isn't coming, so I expect they will cut rates.\" However, George said Thursday's inflation report on consumer prices did not assuage her concerns that inflation is sticky and continues to run well over the Fed's target. That leads her to believe inflation has stalled out around 3%. \"I did for a while think that you'd get a burst of inflation from the tariffs, but we're not seeing that, and I don't know if we will see that,\" she said. \"The more concerning thing to me is just the underlying momentum that inflation has had, and we're continuing to push that out in a forecast.\" The data comes as the central bank has been under extreme pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates and as his nominee to the Fed, Stephen Miran, who will replace former Fed governor Adriana Kugler, is set to be confirmed by the full Senate on Monday. Miran will offer another dovish voice to the Fed. At the same time, a US district court judge ruled Tuesday that President Trump did not have cause to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook due to mortgage allegations and that Cook may remain in place as a Fed governor. The Trump administration said in a court filing Wednesday that it was appealing the decision. The president has been pushing to try to get more of his own nominees on the board of the central bank in time for the September policy meeting as he pushes for lower rates.</p> <ul> <li>CPI rose 0.3% MoM and 3.1% YoY<ul> <li>A stickier inflation report suggests a 25-basis point cut rather than a larger 50 basis point move</li> </ul> </li> <li>the economy added 22,000 jobs in August, weaker than the 75,000 economists expected, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% from 4.2%.<ul> <li>Rate cut is expected</li> </ul> </li> <li>Trump pressure the Fed to cut rates by firing Fed governor Lisa Cook</li> <li>a Judge ruled that Cook may remain in place as a Fed governor</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Market_News/Sep%2016th/","title":"Sep 16th","text":"<ul> <li>Judges blocked the White House from\u00a0ousting Fed Governor Lisa Cook\u00a0for now, allowing her to vote at this week\u2019s rate-setting meeting.

It is facing competition now.</p> <p>Decisions on taxes, spending, and broader economic policy get baked into Treasury bond prices, and then reflected in yields, almost instantaneously. Government borrowing costs can rise and fall based on those movements, making the bond market\u2019s daily assessment of policy impossible to ignore. That is still largely the case. Politicians tend not to dismiss fixed-income markets when they start to signal concern, but the recent vintage of bond vigilantes wields significantly less influence. That has left gold to act as the new canary in the financial market\u2019s coal mine. Bullion prices have risen nearly 38% so far this year, topping $3,500 an ounce for the first time this week. The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, suffered its worst first-half performance in five decades. It remains pinned near the lowest levels in three years relative to a basket of its global peers. Gold was also the best-performing asset over the month of August, according to Bank of America data. It rose about 3.95% as uncertainty about tariffs, data showing inflation is worsening, and President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook rattled investors. As a haven asset, gold has its issues. It doesn\u2019t pay interest, carries costs associated with storage, and can sometimes be difficult to liquidate on short notice. It has also been subject to recent confusion regarding tariffs. But gold has been extremely useful in articulating the market\u2019s crucial macroeconomic tension: that Trump\u2019s tariffs will both blunt growth prospects and stoke consumer-price pressures. Meanwhile, his relentless attacks on the Fed could lead to artificially low interest rates that expose longer-dated bonds to increased inflation risks. \u201cFor many investors, long-dated bonds no longer serve as the default defensive allocation, opening the door for gold to capture a larger share of safe-haven demand alongside other tangible assets such as silver and platinum, both supported by constrained supply outlooks,\u201d Hansen said. Gold is also getting a tailwind from buying by central banks. Those purchases have risen at a record pace over the past three years, led by China\u2019s effort to diversify its foreign-currency holdings away from the U.S. dollar. The People\u2019s Bank of China has added 21 metric tons of gold to its reserves this year, based on calculations from Reuters, taking its overall total to just over 2,300 tons. Tariffs have also slowed global trade, leaving foreign countries without the dollars they would normally earn from selling goods into the U.S. Those dollars were often recycled into U.S. Treasury bonds, but that process appears to be unraveling. Crescat Capital\u2019s macro strategist Otavio Costa notes that global central bank gold holdings represent 27% of their overall reserves, the highest in nearly 30 years. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries, meanwhile, have fallen to around 23%, the lowest since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. It is difficult to focus on the longer-term challenges posed by staggering levels of government debt, or a central bank at risk of coming under the sway of politics, when stocks continue to print all-time highs thanks to the artificial intelligence investment boom. But gold\u2019s recent rally, and the signals it echoes, shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as merely an inflation warning. It is a signal that the U.S. is at risk of losing its role at the center of the financial system as doubts rise about the dollar\u2019s long-term value.</p>"},{"location":"Market_News/Sep%204th/#how-gold-performs","title":"How Gold Performs","text":"<ul> <li>Gold prices topped $3,500 an ounce for the first time this week.</li> <li>Gold was the best-performing asset over the month of August.</li> <li>Purchases from central bank have risen at a record pace over the past three years.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Market_News/Sep%204th/#how-its-competitors-perform","title":"How its Competitors Perform","text":"<ul> <li>The U.S. dollar suffered its worst first-half performance in five decades.
